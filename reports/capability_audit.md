# Capability Audit Snapshot â€” 2025-09-22

| Capability | Status | Existing Artifacts | Gaps | Risks | Minimal Patch Plan | Rollback Plan |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tokenization | Implemented | `src/codex_ml/tokenization/`, numerous pytest modules (`tests/test_tokenizer_*`) | Fence discipline missing in legacy docs describing usage examples. | Confusing onboarding docs may mislead contributors. | Update docs/examples after fence gate lands; cross-link to tests. | Revert doc edits if regressions surface; no code rollback expected. |
| ChatGPT Codex Modeling | Partially Implemented | `src/codex_ml/models/`, registry entries, PEFT hooks | Need refreshed architecture summary to explain LoRA/adapter interplay. | Misconfiguration when extending adapters. | Author design note in docs + ensure registry defaults tested offline. | Revert doc note if inaccurate; keep tests untouched. |
| Training Engine | Implemented | `src/codex_ml/training/`, `train_loop.py`, CLI wrappers | Long-run reproducibility guidance scattered. | Operators may miss required flags when resuming. | Consolidate reproducibility checklist in `reports/` (this run) and refine in later passes. | Remove checklist if contradictions appear; training code unchanged. |
| Configuration Management | Partially Implemented | Hydra configs in `configs/`, CLI overrides | Audit prompt still references remote fetch instructions. | Conflicting guidance leads to misuse of offline gates. | Refresh `AUDIT_PROMPT.md` to align with offline-only operations (this run). | Restore previous prompt if downstream tools depend on it. |
| Evaluation & Metrics | Implemented | `codex_ml/eval`, metrics registry/tests | No central index of available metrics in audit docs. | Duplicate work during audits. | Add summary to future high-signal findings doc. | Remove summary if redundant. |
| Logging & Monitoring | Implemented | `monitoring/`, telemetry modules, logging tests | Observability guidance for audits not centralised. | Slow incident triage. | Schedule observability-focused run from Menu item 5. | Skip if future work reprioritises. |
| Checkpointing & Resume | Implemented | `checkpointing/` tests, `training/checkpoint_*` | Need quick-reference instructions in audit docs. | Operators may skip integrity checks. | Document in `reports/deferred.md` for follow-up doc polish. | Remove note if better location appears. |
| Data Handling | Implemented | `data/`, ingestion pipelines, dataset manifest tests | Audit docs lack summary of dataset fixtures. | Misuse of sample datasets. | Capture highlight in repo map (done) and expand later. | Delete highlight if inaccurate. |
| Security & Safety | Partially Implemented | `safety/`, `security/`, `bandit.yaml`, tests | Markdown fences missing in `docs/ops/security.md`; not yet enforced. | Pre-commit will fail once doc touched. | Track as deferred cleanup; adjust gating scope carefully. | Keep script default scope narrow until cleanup complete. |
| Internal CI/Test | Implemented | `noxfile.py`, `tox.ini`, comprehensive tests | Need pointer to recommended offline command bundle. | Slow onboarding for new auditors. | Populate `reports/local_checks.md` (this run). | Remove doc if superseded. |
| Deployment | Partially Implemented | Docker + deploy scripts | Audit docs do not state offline constraint explicitly. | Contributors may accidentally enable remote workflows. | Emphasise offline rule in prompt rewrite. | Revert wording if conflicts with governance. |
| Documentation & Examples | Partially Implemented | README, docs/ tree | Mixed formatting; lacks central audit instructions. | Hard to discover latest workflow. | Create `reports/` hub (this run) and iterate. | Remove reports if replaced by canonical docs. |
| Experiment Tracking | Partially Implemented | `tracking/`, MLflow helpers | Need statement on offline MLflow usage in audit docs. | Potential network calls by mistake. | Add note to deferred log; plan offline instructions. | Delete note if tracked elsewhere. |
| Extensibility | Implemented | Plugin registries, connectors, tests | Audit docs should highlight extension points. | Onboarding friction. | Note extension directories in repo map (done). | Remove note if duplicative. |
