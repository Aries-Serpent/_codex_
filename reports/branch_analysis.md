# Branch Analysis — 2025-09-22

## Default vs Active Branch

| Item | Observation |
| --- | --- |
| Default branch (local) | `work` (only branch available in repository clone). |
| Recent activity | Latest commit `7b76694` (2025-09-22) merged `0D_base_` into `work`. |
| Remote tracking | No remotes configured; all audit actions must remain local/offline. |

## Focus Justification

- `work` is the only branch present, absorbing upstream merges and housing automation updates. Treat it as both default and active.
- Historical branches (`0A_base_`, `0B_base_`, etc.) are referenced in commit messages but not available locally; no divergence to reconcile during this run.
- Audit outputs should anchor to `work` and highlight drift only when future snapshots introduce new audit artefacts.

## Risks & Follow-Ups

- If additional branches appear later, replicate this analysis and document merge bases before applying fixes.
- Keep an eye on merges from numbered base branches—they may overwrite audit scaffolding if not rebased carefully.
