# _codex_: Status Update (2025-08-29)

## Work Performed
- LoRA adapter now accepts configurable hyper-parameters and always exposes the merged configuration.
- Tests expanded for adapter and CLI, and test coverage gate added.
- Environment inventory captured in `.codex/inventory.txt`.

## Deferred Items
See `.codex/deferred_items.md` for postponed features and maintenance tasks.

## Open Questions
- Should default LoRA hyper-parameters be exposed via project-wide config?
