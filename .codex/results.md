# Results Summary

## Implemented
- Upgraded `parse_when` to support ISO-8601 timestamps with `Z`, explicit offsets, and naive inputs, returning `datetime` objects.
- Added regression tests for `parse_when` covering `Z`, offset, and naive cases.
- Documented supported timestamp formats in `codex/logging/query_logs.py` and updated README.
- Added workflow script `tools/codex_workflow.py` and regenerated project inventory.

## Residual Gaps
- Downstream modules may require further validation against new `parse_when` semantics.

## Pruning Index
- None.

## Next Steps
- Run `pytest` to ensure broader test coverage.
