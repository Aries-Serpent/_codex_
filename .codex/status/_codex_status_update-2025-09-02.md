  - `src/codex/cli.py` defines command groups with `pass` implementations.
  - `codex_ml/utils/checkpointing.py` missing full checkpoint resume logic.
  - `codex_ml/tracking/mlflow_utils.py` provides no-op wrappers when MLflow missing.

## 2. Capability Audit Table
| Capability | Status | Existing Artifacts | Gaps | Risks | Minimal Patch Plan | Rollback Plan |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|------|-------|--------------------|---------------|
| Tokenization | Partially Implemented | `src/codex_ml/tokenization/hf_tokenizer.py` | No fast tokenizer wiring or padding/truncation flags | Inefficient encoding and runtime failures on long sequences | Add padding/truncation arguments and tests | Revert module import to previous revision |

## 3. High-Signal Findings
- Test suite fails due to missing optional dependencies (`httpx`, MLflow).
- Checkpoint resume logic largely unimplemented.
- CLI entry points are stubs, reducing usability.
- Tokenization lacks padding/truncation controls.
- No secrets scanning or security audits.
- Monitoring utilities depend on optional packages without clear fallbacks.
- Documentation lacks quickstart and architecture overview.
- Deployment container lacks firm entrypoints.
- Data handling functions lack deterministic shuffling tests.
- Missing offline experiment tracking examples.

## 4. Atomic Diffs (examples)
1. **Add padding/truncation flags to HF tokenizer**
```diff
@@
-        return self.tokenizer.encode(text, add_special_tokens=False)
+        return self.tokenizer.encode(
+            text,
+            add_special_tokens=False,
+            padding="max_length" if pad_to_max else False,
+            truncation=True,
+        )
```
- *Why*: Enable consistent sequence lengths.
- *Risk*: Incorrect max length may truncate useful context.
- *Rollback*: Revert `hf_tokenizer.py`.
- *Tests/docs*: Add unit test for padding and README note.

2. **Load optimizer/scheduler state in trainer**
```diff
@@
-            # TODO: load model/optimizer state when supported
+            model.load_state_dict(torch.load(os.path.join(ckpt, "model.pt")))
+            optim.load_state_dict(torch.load(os.path.join(ckpt, "optim.pt")))
```
- *Why*: Enable resume from checkpoints.
- *Risk*: Shape mismatch if model changed.
- *Rollback*: Revert training file.
- *Tests/docs*: Integration test restoring from checkpoint.

3. **Guard MLflow init with offline default**
```diff
@@
-    if getattr(args, "mlflow_enable", False) and mlflow is not None:
-        try:
-            uri = getattr(args, "mlflow_tracking_uri", "") or "./mlruns"
-            mlflow.set_tracking_uri(uri)
-            exp = getattr(args, "mlflow_experiment", "codex")
-            mlflow.set_experiment(exp)
-            mlflow.start_run()
-            mlflow_active = True
-        except Exception:
-            mlflow_active = False
+    if getattr(args, "mlflow_enable", False) and mlflow is not None:
+        try:
+            uri = getattr(args, "mlflow_tracking_uri", "") or "file:mlruns"
+            mlflow.set_tracking_uri(uri)
+            mlflow.set_experiment(getattr(args, "mlflow_experiment", "codex"))
+            mlflow.start_run()
+            mlflow_active = True
+        except Exception:
+            mlflow_active = False
```
- *Why*: Default to local file-based tracking.
- *Risk*: MLflow version incompatibility.
- *Rollback*: Revert `codex_logging.py`.
- *Tests/docs*: Unit test mocking mlflow.

## 5. Local Tests & Gates
- `pre-commit run --files _codex_status_update-2025-09-02.md`
- `nox -s tests` *(fails: missing httpx and other optional deps)*
  - Errors: `RuntimeError: The starlette.testclient module requires the httpx package to be installed.`

## 6. Reproducibility Checklist
- [x] Seeds defined in configs (`experiment.seed`).
- [ ] Environment capture scripts.
- [x] Code versioning via git.
- [ ] Deterministic data shuffling tests.
- [ ] Documented hardware/software stack.

## 7. Deferred Items
- Full checkpoint resume: complex, requires cross-team coordination.
- Security scanning: pending decision on tooling (Semgrep vs. Bandit).
- Docker deployment entrypoint: awaiting infra requirements.

## 8. Error Capture Blocks
```
Question for ChatGPT @codex 2025-09-02:
While performing step "nox -s tests", encountered the following error:
RuntimeError: The starlette.testclient module requires the httpx package to be installed.
Context: Running test suite without optional dependency httpx.
What are the possible causes, and how can this be resolved while preserving intended functionality?
```

## Outstanding Codex Automation Questions

Canonical source: docs/status_update_outstanding_questions.md (update there first, then copy the refreshed table below).

| Timestamp(s) | Step / Phase | Recorded blocker | Status | Current disposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-08-28T03:55:32Z | PH6: Run pre-commit | Hook execution failed because `yamllint`, `mdformat`, and `detect-secrets-hook` were missing. | Retired | The active pre-commit configuration only invokes local commands (ruff, black, mypy, pytest, git-secrets, license checker, etc.), so those CLIs are optional for developers and no longer required by automation. |
| 2025-08-28T03:55:32Z | PH6: Run pytest with coverage | `pytest` rejected legacy `--cov=src/codex_ml` arguments. | Retired | Coverage flags were removed from `pytest.ini`, and the nox helper now targets `src/codex`, so the legacy failure mode is obsolete. |
| 2025-08-28T03:55:32Z | PH6: Run pre-commit | `check-merge-conflicts` and ruff flagged merge markers / unused imports. | Retired | The hook set no longer includes `check-merge-conflicts`; ruff/black remain for lint enforcement, so the merge-marker question is superseded. |
| 2025-09-10T05:02:28Z | `nox -s tests` | Coverage session failed during the gate. | Action required | `nox -s tests` still delegates to the coverage session, so the suite must pass with coverage enabled before this blocker can be closed. |
| 2025-09-10T05:45:43Z; 08:01:19Z; 08:01:50Z; 08:02:00Z | Phase 4: `file_integrity_audit compare` | Compare step reported unexpected file changes. | Action required | Expand the allowlists (beyond `.codex/pre_manifest.json`) and rely on move detection before rerunning the audit; the remediation has not been committed yet. |
| 2025-09-10T05:46:35Z; 08:02:12Z; 13:54:41Z | Phase 6: pre-commit | Hook execution failed because `pre-commit` was missing in the environment. | Action required | Install or gate `pre-commit` in the validation environment as documented; automation still expects it to be present. |
| 2025-09-10T05:46:47Z; 08:02:25Z; 13:55:11Z | Phase 6: pytest | Test suite failed under the gate. | Action required | Failures stem from missing optional dependencies and locale/encoding issues; install the extras or skip affected tests per the remediation notes. |
| 2025-09-10T05:46:52Z; 07:14:07Z; 08:02:32Z | Phase 6 & Validation: MkDocs | MkDocs build aborted (strict mode warnings / missing pages). | Mitigated / deferred | MkDocs now runs with `strict: false`, and navigation gaps were patched. Keep docs healthy before attempting to re-enable strict mode. |
| 2025-09-10T07:13:54Z; 11:12:28Z | Validation: pre-commit | `pre-commit` command not found during validation. | Action required | Same remediation as the Phase 6 failures‚Äîinstall or gate `pre-commit` before running validation jobs. |
| 2025-09-10T07:14:03Z; 11:12:36Z | Validation: pytest | Legacy `--cov=src/codex_ml` arguments rejected. | Retired | Covered by the coverage tooling update; remove the legacy flags and rely on the current nox/pytest configuration targeting `src/codex`. |
| 2025-09-10T08:01:17Z | Phase 4: `file_integrity_audit compare` | `file_integrity_audit.py` rejected argument order. | Documented resolution | The script expects `compare pre post --allow-*`; follow the documented invocation to avoid the error. |
| 2025-09-10 (timestamp `$ts`) | `tests_docs_links_audit` | Script crashed with `NameError: name 'root' is not defined`. | Action required | Add `root = Path('.')` (or similar) before using the variable the next time the audit script runs; the fix is recorded but not applied. |
| 2025-09-10T21:10:43Z | Validation: nox | `nox` command not found. | Action required | Install `nox` prior to running the validation gate, per the documented remediation. |
