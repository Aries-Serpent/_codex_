## Completed
- Recorded environment inventory and repository module mapping.
- Enhanced `apply_lora` helper with optional hyper-parameters and safe fallback.

- Logged scan results and quality check outputs under `.codex/`.

## Deferred
- CLI entry via Hydra and metrics NDJSON support.
- Coverage enforcement in nox and corresponding tests.
- `pip-compile` lockfile refresh.

## Notes
- `pre-commit` and `pytest` currently fail on the repository baseline; see `.codex/results.md` for details.
