"""
Package marker for 'scripts'.

Purpose:
- Ensure 'scripts' is recognized as a Python package so absolute imports like
  'from scripts.space_traversal import dup_similarity' resolve reliably when
  running modules and tests across different entrypoints.

Notes:
- This file is intentionally empty (no side effects).
