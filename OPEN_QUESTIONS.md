# Open Questions & Next Steps — Run 2 (2025-09-22)

## Menu Items Covered This Run
- ✅ **Security (4)** — Authored a reusable security sweep template documenting secrets, dependencies, and policy reviews.
- ✅ **Observability (5)** — Added an observability runbook skeleton for logging, metrics, and alert routing.
- ✅ **Self-management (8)** — Published a shared template library to streamline future audit runs and linked it from the prompt.

## Proposed Menu Focus for Run 3
1. **Fix folder (2)** — Target a high-churn directory with the new templates to validate the workflow.
2. **Docs polish (7)** — Flesh out security/observability guidance with concrete examples once data is collected.
3. **Performance (6)** — Profile bottleneck candidates noted in earlier repo mapping.

## Outstanding Questions
- When should we expand the fence validator scope beyond the curated audit artefacts without breaking legacy `.codex/` logs?
- Which reproducibility manifest format best complements the new template library without duplicating telemetry exports?
- What automation is needed to keep the security and observability templates populated between runs?
