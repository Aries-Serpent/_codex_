# Status Update 2025-08-30

## Work Performed
- Logged environment inventory (`.codex/inventory.txt`).
- Mapped existing modules for tokenisation, modelling, training, evaluation, monitoring and checkpointing (`.codex/results.md`).
- Extended LoRA adapter to accept configurable hyper-parameters.
- Added coverage gate to `noxfile.py` to enforce 80% minimum.
- Added basic tests for CLI entry point and LoRA adapter.

## Deferred
See `.codex/deferred_items.md` for items postponed.

## Open Questions
- How should NDJSON metrics toggling integrate with existing Hydra configs?
