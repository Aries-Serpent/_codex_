# Codex Questions (Archived Compatibility Stub)

> **Status:** Archived on 2025-10-17. This file remains only so existing automation that references `Codex_Questions.md` continues to function without raising `FileNotFoundError`.

The historical backlog was archived to `archive/removed/Codex_Questions.md` (tombstone `8e3531b9-c839-4a07-9dec-507c36136eb1`).

- Restore command: `python -m codex.cli archive restore 8e3531b9-c839-4a07-9dec-507c36136eb1 --out Codex_Questions.md`
- Replacement location: consult the archive tombstone for provenance, hashes, and evidence links.

⚠️ **Do not append new questions here.** Update automation to point at the new archival target before writing additional entries.
