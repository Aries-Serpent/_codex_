# Codex Questions (Compatibility Stub)

This stub preserves the root-level `Codex_Questions.md` path so existing automation can append
questions and remediation notes without failing. Historical content has been archived to
[`archive/removed/Codex_Questions.md`](archive/removed/Codex_Questions.md) (tombstone
`8e3531b9-c839-4a07-9dec-507c36136eb1`). Refer to
`docs/arch/adr-2025-10-17-root-docs-cleanup.md` for the migration decision and recovery
instructions.

> **Note:** New tooling should prefer `.codex/notes/Codex_Questions.md`, but this file remains
> as the canonical compatibility target until all workflows have been migrated.
