# Codebase Archival & Hygiene Policy

> Purpose: keep the working tree lean while preserving auditability and supply-chain integrity.

**Method:** remove live code/docs by replacing them with small *tombstone* stubs that include stable IDs and hashes which link to an **append-only evidence log** (JSONL). Reviewers verify provenance through the stub‚Üílog trail in pull requests. For repo-wide end-of-life, set the repository **read-only (Archived)**.

## 1. Governance & Traceability
- **Ownership:** Changes gated by **CODEOWNERS** and branch protection requiring ‚ÄúRequire review from Code Owners.‚Äù
- **Decision record:** Every non-trivial archival has an **ADR** (`/docs/arch/adr-YYYYMMDD-<slug>.md`). Link ADRs from PRs.
- **Provenance:** Attach a lightweight **attestation** (who/when/inputs/digests) aligned with **SLSA/in-toto**.
- **Change log:** Use **Conventional Commits** for commits and **Keep a Changelog** for releases; record deprecations/removals.

## 2. Cadence
- Run ‚Äúarchive hygiene‚Äù each release cycle and **at least quarterly**: *plan ‚Üí execute ‚Üí summarize ‚Üí vacuum*.
- Maintain a predictable deprecation window; publish outcomes in the CHANGELOG.

## 3. Identification (What is ‚Äúdead/pruned‚Äù?)
A unit is a candidate when all are true:
1. **Age/Inactivity** ‚â• œÑ days (default œÑ=180, configurable).
2. **Usage/Refs** == 0 (or below policy threshold) via dependency/usage scans.
3. **Coverage/Ownership** low or orphaned; or explicitly **deprecated**.
4. **Planner score** rates it in the removal band.

> Symbolic policy:  Candidate(p) = ùüô{age(p)‚â•œÑ} ¬∑ ùüô{refs(p)‚â§r_min} ¬∑ ùüô{owner(p)‚ààCODEOWNERS}.
> Decision(p) = Archive with tombstone+attestation if Candidate and ADR approved; else Rescue with ADR + owner.

## 4. Evidence Log (append-only)
- File: `.codex/evidence/archive_ops.jsonl` (one line per archived unit).
- Append-only: new entries only; never rewrite prior lines.
- Each line includes: `id`, `path`, `sha256`, `removed_by`, `when`, `adr`, `reason`, `provenance`.
```json
{"id":"arch-2025-10-16-1234","path":"src/foo/bar.py","sha256":"‚Ä¶","removed_by":"@owner","when":"2025-10-16T19:44:00Z","adr":"docs/arch/adr-0421-archive-foo.md","reason":"orphaned, 0 refs, age>180d","provenance":"attestations/arch-2025-10-16-1234.intoto.jsonl"}
```

## 5. PR Checklist (must pass)
- CODEOWNERS approvals present.
- ADR linked in PR body (Context, Decision, Consequences).
- Conventional Commit message; **BREAKING CHANGE** if applicable.
- Evidence log entry added; tombstone file references `id`/digest.
- SBOM reverse-dep check is green (SPDX/CycloneDX).
- Provenance attestation present and well-formed.
- CHANGELOG updated (Deprecated/Removed).

## 6. Scheduled Hygiene
- Generate planner report; open issues for pending removals.
- Run **summary/vacuum** to prune stale tombstones, refresh summaries.
- Publish CHANGELOG updates (deprecations/removals).

## 7. Safe History Rewrite (exception-only)
If sensitive data leaked into history, use **git-filter-repo** (not `filter-branch`), then coordinate a forced push with stakeholders. Follow GitHub‚Äôs ‚ÄúRemoving sensitive data‚Äù guide.

## 8. Repository-Level Archival
For fully deprecated projects, **archive the repository** (read-only). Update README with migration pointers.

## 9. Retention
Retain evidence logs and attestations per `docs/ops/retention.md`. ADRs are never deleted‚Äîonly superseded.
