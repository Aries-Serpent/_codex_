# 📍_codex_: Status Update (2025-09-22)

## 1. Repo Map
- **Key directories.** `.codex/` captures generated manifests, status artefacts and gate telemetry, while `src/`, `codex_ml/`, `configs/`, `tools/`, `docs/`, `tests/`, `tokenization/`, `training/`, `analysis/` and `services/` house the runtime stack, automation, documentation and integration assets that underpin the platform.【de69c2†L1-L17】
- **Key files.** `pyproject.toml` centralises the pinned runtime plus optional extras for CLI, tracking, PEFT and hardware-specific torch builds; `noxfile.py` enforces offline gate execution with pinned toolchains and coverage artefact logging; and `tools/status/generate_status_update.py` produces deterministic audits for the `.codex/status/` ledger.【F:pyproject.toml†L1-L56】【F:noxfile.py†L1-L89】【F:tools/status/generate_status_update.py†L1-L46】
- **Stubs & placeholders.** The latest automated scan still reports 51 trivial bodies or `NotImplementedError` blocks across connectors, RL interfaces and legacy CLI shims, and highlights that two packages (`src/data`, `src/safety`) remain gitkeep-only placeholders until filled in.【F:.codex/status/_codex_status_update-2025-09-18.md†L5-L79】
- **Recent additions.** The unreleased changelog documents freshly added offline dependency stubs, refreshed gating manifests, deterministic tokenizer and MiniLM tests, and regenerated status artefacts to keep the audit trail current.【F:CHANGELOG.md†L1-L24】

## 2. Capability Audit Table
| Capability | Status | Existing Artifacts | Gaps | Risks | Minimal Patch Plan | Rollback Plan |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tokenization (fast tokenizer, vocab, encode/decode, padding/truncation) | Implemented (optional deps required) | Typer-based CLI commands, SentencePiece training pipeline, and runtime adapters covering Hugging Face, SentencePiece and whitespace tokenisers with BOS/EOS metadata.【F:src/tokenization/cli.py†L1-L159】【F:src/tokenization/train_tokenizer.py†L1-L155】【F:src/codex_ml/tokenization/__init__.py†L1-L109】 | CLI fallback raises at encode time when the `tokenizers` wheel is absent, so offline encode flows depend on installing optional binaries.【F:src/tokenization/cli.py†L91-L149】 | Audit or smoke runs without `tokenizers` fail to exercise encode/decode, masking regressions until dependencies are restored.【F:src/tokenization/cli.py†L91-L149】 | Ship a pure-Python encode fallback (e.g., reuse the whitespace adapter) and gate the optional fast path behind a capability flag; add regression tests in `tests/tokenization` for both code paths. | Revert the fallback helper and restore the current optional-only behaviour if compatibility issues surface. |
| ChatGPT Codex Modeling (model init, dtype, device placement, LoRA/PEFT hooks) | Partially implemented | Built-in MiniLM and decoder-only Transformer models wire through the registry and honour LoRA, dtype and device flags when constructing instances.【F:src/codex_ml/models/minilm.py†L1-L83】【F:src/codex_ml/models/decoder_only.py†L1-L79】【F:src/codex_ml/models/registry.py†L16-L89】 | Only two registry entries ship by default, leaving most connector registries empty and pushing users to author plugins before common baselines (e.g., GPT-style checkpoints) are reachable.【F:src/codex_ml/models/registry.py†L16-L60】【F:.codex/status/_codex_status_update-2025-09-18.md†L126-L137】 | Limited catalogue makes evaluation/experimentation brittle and increases drift risk when teams improvise local forks. | Promote additional pre-trained decoders (e.g., GPT2/GPTNeoX) into the registry with local-files-only guards and document how to extend configs. | Drop the new registry rows to fall back to the minimal MiniLM footprint if downstream validation fails. |
| Training Engine (HF Trainer or custom loop, precision, gradient accumulation) | Implemented (dependency-sensitive) | The symbolic training CLI, checkpoint manager, and toy train loop provide seed control, gradient accumulation, metric logging, retention policies and resume semantics.【F:src/codex/training.py†L1-L82】【F:src/codex_ml/utils/checkpointing.py†L420-L599】【F:src/codex_ml/train_loop.py†L1-L189】 | The default test run fails without heavyweight extras (torch, hydra, numpy, typer), showing the engine still assumes optional stacks are present even though stubs exist.【6e9466†L1-L75】 | Offline QA can miss regressions because collection stops when import errors surface instead of exercising the guarded code paths. | Add lightweight smoke fixtures that skip gracefully when extras are absent and exercise the pure-Python fallbacks; ensure `pytest -q` emits skips instead of hard errors. | Remove the new smoke fixtures if they prove flaky and reinstate the current skip-all strategy. |
| Configuration Management (Hydra/YAML structure, overrides, sweeps) | Partially implemented | Hydra-compatible YAML defaults and a Pydantic schema validate base training settings while the safety policy ships alongside configs.【F:configs/base.yaml†L1-L21】【F:src/codex_ml/config_schema.py†L1-L70】【F:configs/safety/policy.yaml†L1-L82】 | The local Hydra shim attempts to defer to the real package but exposes no-op APIs when Hydra is missing, which currently breaks config validation tests.【F:hydra/__init__.py†L1-L119】【6e9466†L1-L30】 | Contributors may believe Hydra overrides are supported even though the shim silently omits compose/initialise helpers, leading to runtime surprises. | Vendor a minimal compose/initialize wrapper (using OmegaConf) so basic overrides work offline and update docs to list fully supported patterns. | Restore the current shim by reverting the wrapper module if behavioural differences break existing automation. |
| Evaluation & Metrics (validation loops, metrics API, NDJSON/CSV logging) | Implemented | The evaluation runner emits NDJSON/CSV logs, bootstrapped confidence intervals and leverages the metric registry (accuracy, perplexity, EM, F1, diversity).【F:src/codex_ml/eval/eval_runner.py†L1-L128】【F:src/codex_ml/metrics/registry.py†L1-L144】 | Automated scan notes that many metrics/eval modules lack direct test references, leaving the registry additions thinly validated offline.【F:.codex/status/_codex_status_update-2025-09-18.md†L139-L159】 | Silent metric drift or schema regressions could slip through when datasets evolve without corresponding test coverage. | Add focused tests for each metric/eval path and capture golden NDJSON snapshots to flag schema changes. | Drop the new tests if they cause instability and rely on manual validation while gaps are triaged. |
| Logging & Monitoring (TensorBoard / W&B / MLflow, system metrics via psutil/NVML) | Partially implemented | Unified logger bootstrap toggles TensorBoard, W&B, MLflow and NVML-aware GPU sampling, while system metrics helpers stream psutil telemetry to NDJSON.【F:src/codex_ml/monitoring/codex_logging.py†L1-L103】【F:src/codex_ml/monitoring/system_metrics.py†L1-L162】 | GPU/NVML support and psutil sampling are optional; when psutil is absent the background logger raises, and most registries stay empty so plugins must be provided manually.【F:src/codex_ml/monitoring/system_metrics.py†L82-L143】【F:.codex/status/_codex_status_update-2025-09-18.md†L126-L137】 | Missing telemetry dependencies degrade monitoring to no-ops, hiding performance regressions during long offline runs. | Ship psutil as part of the default dev extra, guard NVML initialisation with feature flags, and extend docs with fallback guidance. | Remove the psutil dependency bump if environments cannot accommodate it and keep the current best-effort behaviour. |
| Checkpointing & Resume (weights, optimizer state, scheduler, RNG, best-k retention) | Implemented | `CheckpointManager` persists RNG state, metrics metadata, best-k tracking and handles resume-from-latest, verifying checksums before restore.【F:src/codex_ml/utils/checkpointing.py†L420-L620】 | End-to-end tests still fail without torch and numpy even though the code handles CPU fallbacks, leaving resume paths unverified in minimal environments.【6e9466†L1-L49】 | Operators may assume resume works offline while the lack of exercised coverage masks serializer regressions. | Introduce torch-less smoke tests that save dummy payloads via the pickle path and validate checksum manifests. | Revert the smoke tests if they introduce excessive maintenance overhead relative to the risk. |
| Data Handling (dataset splits, deterministic shuffling, caching) | Implemented | Deterministic split helpers emit manifests and checksums, and the Hugging Face loader falls back to local line datasets when `datasets` is unavailable.【F:src/codex_ml/data/split.py†L1-L118】【F:src/codex_ml/data/hf_datasets.py†L1-L38】 | Broader dataset registries remain empty, so advanced loaders or caching policies must be wired manually per project.【F:.codex/status/_codex_status_update-2025-09-18.md†L126-L137】 | Without curated registries teams may reimplement loaders inconsistently, risking data leakage between experiments. | Populate the dataset registry with canonical corpora (and checksum manifests) plus document cache directory conventions. | Remove new registry entries if downstream deployments prefer bespoke loaders. |
| Security & Safety (dependency locking, secrets scanning, prompt safety) | Partially implemented | Safety filters support deny/allow/redaction rules with environment-configured policy files and dedicated logging, and the repo distributes a default policy pack.【F:src/codex_ml/safety/filters.py†L1-L74】【F:configs/safety/policy.yaml†L1-L99】 | Automated scans still list empty connector/search scaffolding and no automated secrets audit, so coverage depends on manual policy maintenance.【F:.codex/status/_codex_status_update-2025-09-18.md†L21-L36】 | Missing connectors/tests could let unsafe prompts or secrets bypass enforcement until a human reviews the logs. | Extend the safety suite with detector unit tests plus a lightweight secrets scan in pre-commit, and document policy review cadence. | Disable the new hooks if they create false positives and rely on manual review in the interim. |
| Internal CI/Test (pytest targets, tox/nox local gates, coverage enforcement) | Partially implemented | `noxfile.py` provisions reproducible sessions, locks torch installs, logs coverage hashes and integrates with session logging; `pytest.ini` standardises markers and paths.【F:noxfile.py†L1-L120】【F:pytest.ini†L1-L18】 | Running `pytest -q` on a bare environment still fails fast because optional dependencies are missing, so the intended skip markers are not exercised.【6e9466†L1-L75】 | Offline validation pipelines halt before running tests that would otherwise skip, obscuring regressions until dependencies are installed. | Add a `nox -s smoke` session that installs only core deps, validates skip behaviour and documents the expected warning output. | Remove the smoke session if it proves redundant once dependency pinning is widely adopted. |
| Deployment (packaging, CLI entry points, Docker infra) | Partially implemented | Multi-stage Dockerfile builds the API service image with health checks and pinned base packages while CLI entry points live in `pyproject`.【F:Dockerfile†L1-L21】【F:pyproject.toml†L1-L33】 | Container only covers the API slice; broader training/eval images or compose manifests are still placeholders, limiting one-command reproducibility. | Deployments that require training/eval contexts must craft bespoke images, increasing divergence from audited artefacts. | Author minimal training/eval Docker targets (CPU-focused) and document usage alongside the existing API image. | Delete the additional Docker targets if they inflate maintenance cost; the API image already has rollback instructions. |
| Documentation & Examples (README, quickstarts, diagrams, notebooks) | Implemented | Quickstart guide walks through offline environment bootstrapping, tokenizer usage, training, evaluation and telemetry inspection with reproducible commands.【F:docs/quickstart.md†L1-L55】 | Large portions of the docs backlog flagged by earlier audits (architecture diagrams, connector walkthroughs) remain unimplemented, and empty registries have no companion guides.【F:.codex/status/_codex_status_update-2025-09-18.md†L126-L137】 | Contributors rely on stale or missing docs for unfinished modules, increasing onboarding time and misconfiguration risk. | Expand docs with registry how-tos and link remediation plans to concrete examples; include generated diagrams or links once assets exist. | Revert to the lean quickstart if expanded docs fall out of sync; highlight the authoritative remediation plan instead. |
| Experiment Tracking (MLflow local tracking, W&B offline mode) | Implemented (opt-in) | MLflow helpers respect offline env vars and optional enable flags, and the ops guide explains how to activate MLflow/TensorBoard/W&B in local-only mode.【F:src/codex_ml/monitoring/mlflow_utils.py†L1-L72】【F:docs/ops/experiment_tracking.md†L1-L63】 | Optional dependencies remain disabled by default; without psutil/mlflow installs, telemetry devolves to JSON dumps and requires manual activation. | Teams may assume tracking is live when runs actually emit NDJSON only, reducing experiment reproducibility. | Ship a status banner in training/eval CLIs indicating which tracking backends are active and include smoke assertions in examples. | Remove the banner if it causes noise and retain current opt-in semantics. |
| Extensibility (pluggable components, registry patterns) | Partially implemented | Plugin registry infrastructure enforces collision detection and now ships a guarded offline catalogue covering GPT-2/TinyLLaMA assets, the tiny corpus, weighted accuracy, plus functional trainer and heuristic reward-model shims with Hydra/CLI coverage.【F:src/codex_ml/plugins/registries.py†L210-L531】【F:configs/offline/catalogue.yaml†L1-L30】【F:configs/training/offline/functional.yaml†L1-L22】【F:docs/guides/offline_catalogue.md†L45-L108】【F:tests/test_model_registry.py†L131-L142】【F:tests/test_data_registry.py†L50-L60】【F:tests/test_metric_registry.py†L54-L64】【F:tests/test_trainer_reward_registry.py†L5-L38】 | Additional connector and analysis registries remain empty, so bespoke integrations still require custom adapters for now.【F:.codex/status/_codex_status_update-2025-09-18.md†L126-L137】 | Leaving advanced registries sparse may encourage teams to bypass the shared catalogue, fragmenting extension points. | Continue seeding connector/RL registries with audited fixtures and document third-party entry-point publishing patterns alongside the offline preset. | Remove the composite preset if it proves confusing and fall back to manual overrides while retaining the individual entries. |

## 3. High-Signal Findings
1. Automated scanning still reports 51 stubbed symbols across CLI shims, connectors and interfaces, signalling the need to prioritise filling or decommissioning scaffolding that lingers in the tree.【F:.codex/status/_codex_status_update-2025-09-18.md†L5-L68】
    - **Implementation status.** Core runtime adapters (e.g., connectors, RL agent, tokenizer abstractions) now ship concrete implementations with coverage, replacing the empty bodies highlighted in earlier audits.【F:src/codex_ml/connectors/base.py†L1-L139】【F:src/codex_ml/interfaces/rl.py†L1-L148】【F:src/codex_ml/interfaces/tokenizer.py†L1-L120】【F:tests/connectors/test_local_connector.py†L1-L26】
    - **Completion criteria.** Remaining `pass` placeholders in legacy CLI groups (e.g., `codex.cli:cli/logs`) need real command wiring or intentional removal to declare the stub count closed.【F:src/codex/cli.py†L100-L149】
2. Twelve modules (including monitoring CLIs and dataset loaders) lack direct test references, so gating on `pytest -q` requires either optional dependency installation or additional smoke coverage to avoid silent regressions.【F:.codex/status/_codex_status_update-2025-09-18.md†L139-L168】【6e9466†L1-L75】
    - **Implementation status.** Newly added async connector and RNG checkpoint suites demonstrate the pattern for lightweight smoke coverage without heavy dependencies, showing that the test harness can exercise optional paths incrementally.【F:tests/connectors/test_local_connector.py†L1-L26】【F:tests/utils/test_checkpoint_rng.py†L1-L25】
    - **Completion criteria.** Author focused smoke tests for the uncovered modules (e.g., `codex_ml.monitoring.cli`, `codex_ml.plugins.registries`, `codex_ml.data.cli`) that `importorskip` heavy extras yet validate CLI wiring; the monitoring CLI already exposes deterministic transforms suitable for fixture-based assertions.【F:src/codex_ml/monitoring/cli.py†L1-L60】【F:src/codex_ml/plugins/registries.py†L1-L57】【F:src/codex_ml/data/cli.py†L1-L120】
3. The Hydra shim continues to mask missing functionality, and config-related tests fail without the real library—updating the shim or providing OmegaConf fallbacks should be treated as a near-term remediation item.【F:hydra/__init__.py†L1-L122】【6e9466†L1-L30】
    - **Implementation status.** The shim now attempts to load the real Hydra package from virtual environments and gracefully falls back to a no-op `main` decorator, eliminating import-time crashes in offline runs.【F:hydra/__init__.py†L1-L94】
    - **Completion criteria.** Provide minimal `initialize`/`compose` wrappers backed by OmegaConf so configuration overrides work identically offline, and document the supported subset directly in the shim once parity is achieved.【F:hydra/__init__.py†L95-L122】
4. The checkpoint manager now stores RNG state, metadata and best-k rotation, meaning resume workflows are feature-complete once torch-backed smoke tests are restored.【F:src/codex_ml/utils/checkpointing.py†L420-L567】
    - **Implementation status.** Regression tests already confirm RNG round-trips and best-k manifests, validating the persistence guarantees without requiring torch on disk.【F:tests/utils/test_checkpoint_rng.py†L1-L25】
    - **Completion criteria.** Re-enable a torch-backed smoke in CI once optional wheels are available so GPU/optimizer state restoration paths are validated alongside the pickle fallback.【F:src/codex_ml/utils/checkpointing.py†L462-L544】
5. Training and evaluation loops consistently emit NDJSON/CSV metrics alongside config hashes, providing reproducibility hooks that can be tapped by additional automation or dashboards.【F:src/codex_ml/train_loop.py†L1-L199】【F:src/codex_ml/eval/eval_runner.py†L1-L109】
    - **Implementation status.** Both loops already stream metrics and provenance to deterministic JSON artefacts, and evaluation bootstraps metrics with optional confidence intervals for audit trails.【F:src/codex_ml/train_loop.py†L80-L199】【F:src/codex_ml/eval/eval_runner.py†L49-L109】
    - **Completion criteria.** Add automation hooks that ingest the NDJSON outputs into the monitoring CLI (or dashboards) so regressions surface automatically instead of relying on manual inspection.【F:src/codex_ml/monitoring/cli.py†L11-L55】
6. Offline logging continues to improve with unified CLI flags and psutil-backed system metrics, but missing psutil/NVML installations still degrade telemetry to no-ops—pinning psutil in dev environments is recommended.【F:src/codex_ml/monitoring/codex_logging.py†L1-L200】【F:src/codex_ml/monitoring/system_metrics.py†L1-L167】
    - **Implementation status.** Telemetry bootstrappers now expose consistent CLI/Hydra flags, and the system metrics logger records host telemetry whenever psutil is available.【F:src/codex_ml/monitoring/codex_logging.py†L77-L200】【F:src/codex_ml/monitoring/system_metrics.py†L26-L167】
    - **Completion criteria.** Ship `psutil` inside the `dev` extra so local smoke runs have telemetry by default, and gate NVML setup behind explicit feature flags to avoid runtime failures when CUDA libraries are absent.【F:pyproject.toml†L32-L96】【F:src/codex_ml/monitoring/codex_logging.py†L98-L117】
7. Deterministic dataset splitting now writes manifests and checksums, aligning with reproducibility goals and giving future audits concrete artefacts to diff.【F:src/codex_ml/data/split.py†L1-L198】
    - **Implementation status.** The helper emits schema-tagged manifests plus checksum files, making it trivial to audit dataset drift across runs.【F:src/codex_ml/data/split.py†L18-L198】
    - **Completion criteria.** Integrate the manifest writer with dataset registry entries so each canonical corpus advertises its checksum set alongside loading helpers.【F:src/codex_ml/data/registry.py†L13-L101】
8. Experiment tracking remains opt-in; the ops guide outlines MLflow/W&B offline flows, but CLI banners or smoke outputs would help prevent misunderstandings about active backends.【F:docs/ops/experiment_tracking.md†L1-L63】
    - **Implementation status.** Documentation clearly states offline-first workflows and the CLI flags required to enable MLflow, TensorBoard or W&B locally.【F:docs/ops/experiment_tracking.md†L10-L63】
    - **Completion criteria.** Update training/eval CLIs to emit a startup summary of enabled trackers (e.g., MLflow URI, TensorBoard logdir) so users immediately see which integrations are active.【F:src/codex_ml/train_loop.py†L180-L199】
9. Quickstart documentation already demonstrates fully offline bootstrapping (uv sync, tokenizer training, toy training, evaluation), making it a reliable onboarding entry point for new contributors.【F:docs/quickstart.md†L1-L55】
    - **Implementation status.** Step-by-step commands cover environment setup, tokenizer usage, deterministic training, evaluation and telemetry inspection without network calls.【F:docs/quickstart.md†L7-L55】
    - **Completion criteria.** Link each quickstart stage to the corresponding automation (status generator, manifest writer, monitoring CLI) so new contributors can trace how artefacts flow into audits automatically.【F:tools/status/generate_status_update.py†L1-L46】【F:src/codex_ml/monitoring/cli.py†L11-L55】
10. The changelog confirms recurring offline hardening work (dependency stubs, regenerated status artefacts), showing that audit hygiene is embedded in day-to-day maintenance.【F:CHANGELOG.md†L1-L32】
    - **Implementation status.** Recent entries log dependency pins, regenerated status artefacts and regression tests that align with the remediation roadmap.【F:CHANGELOG.md†L3-L32】
    - **Completion criteria.** Continue tying each high-signal remediation (tests, telemetry guards, registry population) to explicit changelog bullets so auditors can trace when gaps closed relative to status updates.【F:CHANGELOG.md†L3-L32】

## 4. Testing
- `pytest -q` – **failed** because optional dependencies such as `torch`, `hydra`, `numpy` and `typer` are not installed in the current offline environment; collection stops before reaching guarded skips.【6e9466†L1-L75】

## 5. Outstanding Codex Automation Questions
<!-- Copied from docs/status_update_outstanding_questions.md -->

> 2025-09-18: Base and optional extras now use strict version pins in `pyproject.toml` and the refreshed lock files. Use `uv sync --frozen` (or `uv pip sync requirements.lock`) and avoid `pip install -U ...` when preparing environments so the gates run against the pinned toolchain.【F:docs/status_update_outstanding_questions.md†L1-L37】
