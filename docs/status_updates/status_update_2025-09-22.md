Audit Scope

# üìç_codex_: Status Update (2025-09-22)

1. **Repo Map**
   - **Top-level directories.** `src/` (runtime packages for `codex`, `codex_ml`, tokenization, monitoring), `configs/` (Hydra-friendly defaults), `docs/` (MkDocs site with quickstarts, ops guides, and remediation queues), `.codex/` (automation artefacts and NDJSON session logs), `tools/` (status and maintenance utilities), `tests/` (unit/integration suites), `training/` (notebook-style walkthroughs), `deploy/` + `ops/` (infra playbooks), `tokenization/` (offline assets), and `artifacts/` (coverage/metrics exports).
   - **Key files.** `pyproject.toml` (extras + entry points), `noxfile.py` (tests, lint, coverage), `Makefile` and `codex.mk` (task orchestration), `tox.ini` (legacy gate), `mkdocs.yml` (documentation nav), `Dockerfile` (runtime image), `.codex/status/*.md` (automated audits), and `requirements.lock` (pinned dependencies).
   - **Stubs & placeholders.** Automated audit (`.codex/status/_codex_status_update-2025-09-18.md`) flags 51 stubbed or `NotImplementedError` members across CLI shells, registry interfaces, and tokenizer adapters; `src/data/` and `src/safety/` remain `.gitkeep` placeholders awaiting implementations. `src/codex/cli.py` retains stubbed groups for `logs`, `tokenizer`, and `repro` commands.
   - **Recent changes.** `CHANGELOG.md` lists 2025-09-21 updates covering offline registry scaffolds, regenerated status artefacts, and hardened gating manifests to keep automation reproducible.

2. **Capability Audit Table**

| Capability | Status | Existing Artifacts | Gaps | Risks | Minimal Patch Plan | Rollback Plan |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tokenization (fast tokenizer, vocab, encode/decode, padding/truncation) | Partially Implemented | `src/tokenization/cli.py` CLI, tokenizer adapters under `src/codex_ml/tokenization/`, offline assets in `tokenization/` | Encode path raises when optional `tokenizers` wheel missing; adapter classes in `codex_ml/tokenization` remain stubbed; padding/truncation manifests undocumented | Offline environments cannot validate encode/decode; regression detection delayed | Add whitespace/pure-Python fallback with feature-flag toggle, fill adapter stubs, document fallback in docs/tokenization guide, add regression tests under `tests/tokenization/` | Remove fallback helper and revert adapter methods to stubs if compatibility drifts or performance regresses |
| ChatGPT Codex Modeling (model init, dtype, device placement, LoRA/PEFT hooks) | Partially Implemented | `src/codex_ml/models/registry.py`, TinyLLaMA/GPT-2 builders, LoRA config hooks, dtype/device guards in `codex_ml/models/utils.py` | Connector, dataset, and plugin registries remain empty; LoRA recipes undocumented; dtype/device overrides not exposed through CLI | Teams craft divergent registry definitions, risking drift and inconsistent LoRA/device placement | Populate registry files with curated GPT-2/TinyLLaMA entries, expose CLI flags for dtype/device/LoRA, add docs walkthrough | Revert registry additions to MiniLM/BERT-only baseline if regressions appear, remove CLI toggles |
| Training Engine (HF Trainer or custom loop, precision, gradient accumulation) | Implemented (dependency-sensitive) | `src/codex_ml/train_loop.py`, Typer CLI wrappers, gradient accumulation + precision controls, NDJSON logging | Optional stacks (`torch`, `hydra`, `mlflow`) required; no automated smoke test for fallback path when dependencies missing | Offline QA fails before exercising gradient accumulation or telemetry hooks, hiding regressions | Add dependency-skipping smoke tests, extend `nox -s tests` to run fallback-only suite, document required extras in README | Remove smoke tests and revert nox session if flakiness appears in constrained environments |
| Configuration Management (Hydra/YAML structure, overrides, sweeps) | Partially Implemented | `configs/` tree, OmegaConf schema (`src/codex_ml/config_schema.py`), lightweight Hydra shim (`hydra/__init__.py`) | Shim lacks `initialize`/`compose` parity; no sweep orchestration; config search path assumptions undocumented | Users expect Hydra semantics and hit runtime errors on overrides; sweep automation blocked | Implement OmegaConf-backed `initialize`/`compose`, document supported subset, add tests verifying offline overrides; capture config search path guidance | Drop wrappers to revert to decorator-only shim if compatibility diverges or adds maintenance burden |
| Evaluation & Metrics (validation loops, metrics API, NDJSON/CSV logging) | Partially Implemented | `src/codex_ml/eval/eval_runner.py`, metrics registry (`src/codex_ml/metrics/registry.py`), NDJSON/CSV writers | Metric modules lack dedicated tests; NDJSON schema snapshots absent; registry coverage minimal | Schema drift or metric regressions go unnoticed; downstream analytics break silently | Create golden-file tests per metric, extend registry entries, integrate snapshots into `nox` gate | Revert golden files/tests if they become brittle and rely on manual CLI validation |
| Logging & Monitoring (TensorBoard / W&B / MLflow, system metrics via psutil/NVML) | Partially Implemented | `src/codex_ml/monitoring/codex_logging.py`, `system_metrics.py`, telemetry CLI | psutil/NVML optional installs; NVML default-on causing warnings; docs lack explicit fallback messaging | Missing telemetry masks performance regressions; noisy warnings degrade UX | Pin `psutil` in dev extras, gate NVML behind explicit flag, add CLI banner for disabled integrations | Remove dependency pin and feature flags if compatibility issues occur |
| Checkpointing & Resume (weights, optimizer state, scheduler, RNG, best-k retention) | Implemented | `src/codex_ml/utils/checkpointing.py` (best-k rotation, RNG capture), tests under `tests/utils/test_checkpoint_rng.py` | Torch-less fallback path untested; latest checkpoint manifest coverage minimal | CPU-only environments assume resume works but pickle fallbacks unchecked | Add pickle-path smoke tests storing dummy payloads, extend manifest validation, surface CLI example | Drop pickle smoke tests if they add brittleness and rely on torch-backed coverage |
| Data Handling (dataset splits, deterministic shuffling, caching) | Partially Implemented | `src/codex_ml/data/split.py`, dataset manifest helpers, caching utilities | Dataset registry empty; caching guidance absent; offline manifests not discoverable from CLI | Contributors reimplement loaders, risking inconsistent splits or leakage | Populate `codex_ml/data/registry.py` with curated corpora + manifests, document CLI to sync caches | Remove registry entries if teams require bespoke datasets, keep deterministic splitter standalone |
| Security & Safety (dependency locking, secrets scanning, prompt safety) | Partially Implemented | Dependency locks (`requirements.lock`, `uv.lock`), safety filters (`src/codex_ml/safety/filters.py`), policy pack (`configs/safety/policy.yaml`) | No automated safety filter tests; secrets scanning absent from pre-commit; policy update workflow informal | Unsafe prompts or secrets may bypass filters until manual review; dependency drift unmonitored | Add redaction/allow/block unit tests, integrate detect-secrets or equivalent offline scan, version policy updates | Disable new checks if false positives overwhelm contributors, revert to manual review backlog |
| Internal CI/Test (pytest targets, tox/nox local gates, coverage enforcement) | Partially Implemented | `noxfile.py`, `tox.ini`, `Makefile`, `codex.mk` tasks, `pytest.ini` | Modules lacking direct test references (20 flagged), no coverage budget enforcement, stub CLI commands uncovered | Regressions slip through; stubbed CLI stays unimplemented | Add targeted pytest modules for flagged packages, enforce coverage threshold in nox, wire stub CLI tests | Rollback coverage enforcement by adjusting nox session if pipelines fail unexpectedly |
| Deployment (packaging, CLI entry points, Docker infra) | Partially Implemented | Multi-stage `Dockerfile`, `deploy/` runbooks, CLI entry points in `pyproject.toml` | No training/eval container images; compose manifests limited; docs missing usage for new targets | Teams craft bespoke images causing drift; reproducibility suffers | Author CPU-friendly training/eval Docker targets, document usage in README/ops guides | Remove new targets if maintenance high; keep API image as baseline |
| Documentation & Examples (README, quickstarts, diagrams, notebooks) | Partially Implemented | `docs/quickstart.md`, ops guides, tutorials, notebooks, CHANGELOG | MkDocs strict mode disabled; registry/catalogue docs outdated; onboarding lacks diagrams | Navigation drift hides broken links; onboarding time increases | Deduplicate nav, restore `strict: true`, add registry walkthroughs + diagrams | Revert nav changes if strict mode blocks releases; maintain quickstart references |
| Experiment Tracking (MLflow local tracking, W&B offline mode) | Implemented (opt-in) | `src/codex_ml/monitoring/mlflow_utils.py`, docs in `docs/ops/experiment_tracking.md`, Typer hooks | Tracking disabled by default; CLI lacks explicit status messaging; offline store bootstrap manual | Operators assume tracking active when only NDJSON logs produced | Emit CLI banner summarizing enabled integrations, add offline MLflow bootstrap helper | Remove banner/helper if it confuses automation, revert to current silent behaviour |
| Extensibility (pluggable components, registry patterns) | Partially Implemented | Registry base classes (`src/codex_ml/registry/base.py`), plugin scaffolds, connectors package | Many registry modules empty; plugin loader CLI stubbed; extension guide incomplete | Integrators fork codebase, leading to drift and unreviewed hooks | Fill registry stubs with reference implementations, finish plugin CLI, extend docs with registry cookbook | Drop additions if plugin API breaks consumers; revert to minimal skeleton |

3. **High-Signal Findings**
   1. Optional `tokenizers` wheel remains a hard dependency for encode/decode, blocking offline validation paths.
   2. Hydra shim offers only the decorator wrapper‚Äîno `initialize`/`compose` parity for overrides or sweeps.
   3. Dataset, connector, and plugin registries are empty, preventing reproducible catalog discovery.
   4. Twenty modules lack mapped tests, undermining confidence in coverage and gating.
   5. Safety filters and policy packs ship without automated tests or secrets scanning.
   6. Telemetry stack depends on optional psutil/NVML binaries without default-off NVML guardrails.
   7. Checkpoint pickle fallback is untested, so CPU-only resume scenarios remain speculative.
   8. Documentation nav still requires strict-mode disablement; registry how-tos trail implementation backlog.
   9. Stubbed CLI groups (`logs`, `tokenizer`, `repro`) persist in `src/codex/cli.py`, limiting UX cohesion.
   10. Experiment tracking defaults to silent NDJSON logging, causing confusion when MLflow/W&B are disabled.
   11. Offline manifests exist but aren‚Äôt surfaced via CLI or docs, increasing manual toil.
   12. Automation does not ingest NDJSON telemetry outputs into the status ledger, leaving observability manual.

4. **Atomic Diffs**

### Atomic Diff 1 ‚Äî Tokenizer fallback for offline encode
- **Why:** Provide encode/decode capability when the fast `tokenizers` wheel is unavailable, keeping offline smoke tests meaningful.
- **Risk:** Pure-Python fallback may be slower and diverge on edge cases.
- **Rollback:** Remove the fallback helper and restore the current exception behaviour.
- **Tests/docs:** Add unit tests covering fast and fallback paths; document the toggle in docs/tokenization.
```diff
diff --git a/src/tokenization/cli.py b/src/tokenization/cli.py
@@
-    enc = tk.encode(text)
+    try:
+        enc = tk.encode(text)
+    except RuntimeError:
+        enc = whitespace_encode(text)
         if show_ids:
             typer.echo("ids: " + " ".join(str(i) for i in enc.ids))
```

### Atomic Diff 2 ‚Äî OmegaConf-backed Hydra shim
- **Why:** Restore `initialize`/`compose` equivalence for offline overrides and sweeps without installing full Hydra.
- **Risk:** Divergence from upstream Hydra semantics could confuse contributors.
- **Rollback:** Delete the new helpers and keep the decorator-only shim.
- **Tests/docs:** Add pytest module `tests/hydra/test_shim_compose.py` and README note on supported subset.
```diff
diff --git a/hydra/__init__.py b/hydra/__init__.py
@@

+    base = Path(config_path or "config").resolve()
+    return {"config_dir": base, "job_name": job_name, "version_base": version_base}

+    if overrides:
+        cfg = OmegaConf.merge(cfg, OmegaConf.from_dotlist(overrides))
+    return (cfg, None) if return_hydra_config else cfg
```

### Atomic Diff 3 ‚Äî Telemetry dependency pin + NVML guard
- **Why:** Ensure psutil-backed sampling works by default and NVML activation is explicit.
- **Risk:** Dependency pin may conflict with downstream environments.
- **Rollback:** Remove psutil from the dev extra and revert NVML flag default.
- **Tests/docs:** Refresh locks, run `nox -s tests`, and update docs/ops/experiment_tracking.
```diff
diff --git a/pyproject.toml b/pyproject.toml

     "pytest==8.4.1",
     "pytest-cov==7.0.0",
@@
     "nox==2025.5.1",
+    "psutil==6.0.0",
 ]
```

### Atomic Diff 4 ‚Äî MkDocs strict mode restoration
- **Why:** Re-enable strict navigation checks to catch doc rot as part of local gating.
- **Risk:** Strict mode may block releases until navigation duplicates are resolved.
- **Rollback:** Flip `strict: false` in `mkdocs.yml` if strict validation proves disruptive.
- **Tests/docs:** Run `mkdocs build --strict` via `nox -s docs`; update docs/navigation changelog if paths move.
```diff
diff --git a/mkdocs.yml b/mkdocs.yml

5. **Local Tests & Gates**

| Command | Purpose | Example Output | ML Test Score Coverage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `nox -s tests` | Runs full pytest suite with coverage artefacts. | `tests: 412 passed, 17 skipped` | Model, data, regression |
| `pytest tests/tokenization/test_cli_whitespace.py -q` | Validates tokenizer fallback encode/decode. | `3 passed in 0.45s` | Data, regression |
| `pytest tests/hydra/test_shim_compose.py -q` | Ensures Hydra shim overrides resolve deterministically. | `2 passed in 0.21s` | Infrastructure, reproducibility |
| `pytest tests/monitoring/test_system_metrics.py -q` | Confirms psutil-backed telemetry and NVML gating behaviour. | `4 passed, 1 skipped (NVML absent)` | Infrastructure, performance |
| `pytest tests/utils/test_checkpoint_pickle.py -q` | Verifies pickle checkpoint fallback and manifest integrity. | `2 passed` | Model, reproducibility |

6. **Reproducibility Checklist**

| Item | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Seed control across training/eval loops | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Seeds exposed in CLI but fallback smoke tests missing; document deterministic settings. |
| Environment capture (requirements locks, manifests) | ‚úÖ Present | `requirements.lock`, `uv.lock`, and `.codex/status` exports capture versions. |
| Data/version manifests | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Split helper emits manifests but registries empty; caches undocumented. |
| Configuration capture & overrides | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Base configs present; Hydra shim missing full parity. |
| Deterministic hardware/runtime notes | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Telemetry docs highlight CPU/GPU variance but NVML gating not default-off. |
| Results logging & provenance | ‚úÖ Present | NDJSON/CSV metrics, MLflow hooks, session logs in `.codex/`. |

7. **Deferred Items**
   - **Registry population backlog.** Populate dataset/connector/plugin registries after governance review of canonical corpora; deferral due to missing ownership for dataset hosting. Interim: rely on manual manifests while assembling review panel.
   - **Full Hydra sweep support.** Building an offline sweeps orchestrator is large in scope; defer until minimal `initialize`/`compose` landing proves stable. Interim: document manual override sequences.
   - **Secrets scanning automation.** Integrating detect-secrets requires consensus on baseline; postpone until policy team finalizes exception handling. Interim: continue manual checklist during reviews.
   - **NDJSON ingestion pipeline.** Automated telemetry aggregation depends on storage approval; backlog until ops capacity frees up. Interim: instruct teams to run `codex monitoring export` manually.

8. **Error Capture Blocks**
   - No analysis errors encountered during this audit; no error capture blocks recorded.

## Codex-ready Task Sequence

```yaml
Codex-ready Task Sequence:
  1. Preparation:
    - Step 1.1: Sync local branch with origin/main and ensure locks (`requirements.lock`, `uv.lock`) are current.
    - Step 1.2: Create workspace scratchpad noting impacted modules (tokenization, hydra shim, telemetry, docs).
    - Step 1.3: Activate offline virtualenv with dev extras installed (pip install -e .[dev]).
  2. Search & Mapping:
    - Step 2.1: Inspect README and docs/quickstart.md for existing tokenizer and telemetry references.
    - Step 2.2: Enumerate registry files under `src/codex_ml/**/registry.py` and log empty entries.
    - Step 2.3: Review `.codex/status` reports for stubbed methods requiring implementation.
  3. Best-Effort Construction:
    - Step 3.1: Implement whitespace tokenizer fallback with feature flag and update docs.
    - Step 3.2: Extend Hydra shim with OmegaConf-backed `initialize`/`compose` wrappers.
    - Step 3.3: Populate dataset/model registry entries and expose CLI flags for dtype/device/LoRA.
    - Step 3.4: Add pytest modules for new functionality and wire commands into `nox -s tests`.
  4. Controlled Pruning:
    - Step 4.1: If registry population exceeds governance scope, document unresolved entries and mark for deferred review.
    - Step 4.2: If Hydra shim diverges from upstream semantics, wrap helper behind environment variable and document fallback rationale.
    - Step 4.3: If telemetry dependency conflicts arise, remove psutil pin and capture manual install instructions in docs/ops.
  5. Error Capture:
    - Step 5.1: On encountering runtime/import failures, emit block:
      Question from ChatGPT @codex {{timestamp}}:
      While performing [STEP_NUMBER:STEP_DESCRIPTION], encountered the following error: [ERROR_MESSAGE]
      Context: [BRIEF_CONTEXT]. What are the possible causes, and how can this be resolved while preserving intended functionality?
  6. Finalization:
    - Step 6.1: Run `nox -s tests` and targeted pytest modules; archive outputs under `artifacts/`.
    - Step 6.2: Update changelog and docs to reflect new registry entries and telemetry defaults.
    - Step 6.3: Produce PR summary referencing High-Signal Findings and attach reproducibility checklist updates.
