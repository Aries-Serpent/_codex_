This document merges the last applied atomic diffs (training CLI, checkpoint utilities, API /infer wiring, secret filtering) with the implementation summary provided. It is an authoritative, concise reference for reviewers and maintainers.

1) High-level summary
- Purpose: Introduce optional model/LoRA wiring into the training loop, lightweight checkpoint helpers, a Hydra training CLI/config, and safer API inference wiring with expanded secret masking. All changes are intentionally offline-first and guarded by optional deps.
- Scope: Additive changes only — new files, guarded integrations, minimal changes within train_loop and API code paths.

2) Quick change matrix

| Area | Change | Principal files |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| Training Loop | model + LoRA integration hooks, checkpoint saving per-epoch, deterministic default seed (1234), new params | src/codex_ml/train_loop.py |
| Checkpoint wrapper | Thin wrapper around existing checkpointing + JSON sidecar | src/codex_ml/utils/checkpoint.py |
| Hydra Config | Training config group (lean, non-conflicting) | configs/train/default.yaml |
| Hydra CLI | Hydra entrypoint that calls run_training | src/codex_ml/cli/train.py |
| API Inference | Lazy load tokenizer/model, encode→decode flow, secret masking, fallbacks | services/api/main.py |
| Secret Filtering | Extended regexes: OpenAI, AWS, GCP, GitHub PAT, Slack | services/api/main.py |
| Tests | Checkpoint roundtrip test (torch-guarded), hydra CLI tests guarded for missing deps | tests/test_checkpoint_util.py, tests/test_hydra_cli.py |

3) Files affected (concise)

| Path | Type | Key lines / contents |
|------|------|----------------------|
| src/codex_ml/train_loop.py | Modified | run_training signature extended; model instantiation & LoRA apply (guarded); epoch checkpoint save; model param metrics |
| src/codex_ml/utils/checkpoint.py | Added | save_checkpoint/load_checkpoint wrapper calling repo checkpointing primitives + metadata.json sidecar |
| configs/train/default.yaml | Added | seed, epochs, lora block, checkpoint block, device/dtype |
| src/codex_ml/cli/train.py | Added | Hydra entrypoint resolving cfg -> run_training(...) call |
| services/api/main.py | Modified | SECRET_PATTERNS expanded; helpers: _mask_secrets, _load_tokenizer, _load_model, _encode/_decode; /infer uses tokenizer/model path |
| tests/test_checkpoint_util.py | Added | Guarded by pytest.importorskip("torch") for save/load roundtrip |
| tests/test_hydra_cli.py | Modified | Module-level guarded skips for missing hydra/omegaconf; CLI smoke tests when available |

4) Behavioral changes (summary)

| Behavior | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Default deterministic seed | PID/time-derived (non-deterministic) | Seed 1234 when seed==0 or None (deterministic offline) |
| run_training metrics | Demo loop only | Optional model_params added when model available |
| Checkpointing from train loop | Absent | Per-epoch checkpoint directories + latest.json sidecar when checkpoint_dir provided |
| /infer | Echo with basic sk- filter | Tokenizer→encode→decode flow, secret masking across more patterns, lazy cached components |
| Model/LoRA | No wiring | Optional model_name, lora, lora_cfg, device, dtype parameters — guarded by torch/peft presence |

5) Security & offline considerations
- Secret masking expanded to include: OpenAI sk-, AWS AKIA/ASIA patterns, Google API keys starting with AIza, GitHub PATs (ghp_), Slack tokens (xox[baprs]-). Environment variable DISABLE_SECRET_FILTER=1 disables masking.
- Model/tokenizer loads are guarded to prefer local-only (offline-first) and fall back to an echo tokenizer/model in absence of HF/tokenizer registries.
- No network-only actions are unguarded; no remote downloads attempted automatically.

6) Testing & gating
- tests/test_checkpoint_util.py: saves and loads a tiny torch model, skipped if torch is absent (pytest.importorskip).
- tests/test_hydra_cli.py: module-level guards to skip when Hydra/OmegaConf unavailable. Hydra-dependent tests run only in fully provisioned dev environments.
- Locally, a small subset of tests (smoke paths) were executed; heavy-dep tests skipped where dependencies missing.

7) Known gaps and deferred items
- Resume logic (load latest checkpoint) is not implemented yet — recommended follow-up.
- Full training engine (AMP, optimizer, proper grad accumulation loop) remains TODO.
- Additional API /infer unit tests for tokenization + secret redaction are recommended.
- docs/reproducibility.md and expanded dev docs suggested.

8) Rollback plan
- Revert train_loop changes (remove added params & checkpoint code).
- Delete src/codex_ml/utils/checkpoint.py.
- Remove configs/train/default.yaml and src/codex_ml/cli/train.py.
- Replace /infer with prior echo implementation in services/api/main.py.

9) Minimal usage examples
- Hydra train (example):
  python -m codex_ml.cli.train epochs=1 model_name=MiniLM checkpoint.dir=artifacts/ckpts
- Legacy raw loop:
  python -m codex_ml.train_loop --epochs 1 --grad-accum 2
- API call that demonstrates masking:
  curl -X POST localhost:8000/infer -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"prompt":"aws key AKIA1234567890EXAMPLE"}'
  → completion masks key: "[SECRET]"

10) Follow-ups (prioritized)
1. P1: Implement resume by reading latest.json and load_checkpoint wrapper.
2. P1: Replace demo_epoch with a small but realistic train_step loop (optimizer, scheduler, gradient accumulation, optional AMP).
3. P2: Add deterministic JSONL/CSV dataset loaders, caching keyed by SHA256.
4. P2: Add /infer unit tests that assert token reconstruction and secret masking.
5. P3: Document reproducibility (docs/reproducibility.md) and local MLflow usage behind env toggles.

11) Verification digest (applied commits)
- commit 6618100 (primary patch)
- commit e479883 (test import adjustments)

12) Short risks & mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Model load failure causing silent omission of model_params | Model loading is try/except guarded; metrics omit model_params gracefully and logs warn. |
| Secret regex false positives | Patterns designed with prefixes (e.g., AKIA, AIza, ghp_, xox...) and minimum lengths to reduce false positives; DISABLE_SECRET_FILTER allows bypass. |
| Storage growth from checkpoints | Checkpoint directories are epoch-based to enable external cleanup policy; recommend retention policy in follow-up docs. |

If you want I can:
- produce a PR body and open a draft PR summarizing these changes (I can generate the PR description and call the repo tools),
- or implement one of the follow-ups (resume logic or small optimizer-backed training loop) and add tests.
