`set_reproducible()` seeds Python, NumPy and PyTorch, enables deterministic
algorithms and disables cuDNN benchmarking. The custom training loop in
`training/functional_training.py` asserts that `torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic`
is set when CUDA is available, helping catch non-deterministic operations
early. Call `set_reproducible()` or set `torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True`
before training on GPU to satisfy this check.
