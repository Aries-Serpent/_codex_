# Why Diátaxis for Codex docs?

Codex documentation is being reorganized iteratively around the four complementary pillars of the Diátaxis framework:

- **Tutorials** — learning-oriented walkthroughs that teach new capabilities.
- **How-to guides** — goal-oriented procedures for accomplishing specific tasks.
- **Reference** — information-oriented pages that describe commands and APIs.
- **Explanation** — understanding-oriented context, rationale, and design notes.

We add pages opportunistically as they become ready and cross-link them from the index to help contributors discover coverage gaps.
