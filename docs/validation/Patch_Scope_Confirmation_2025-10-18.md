# [Validation]: Patch Scope Confirmation (v1.1.0)
> Generated: 2025-10-18 09:13:17 UTC | Author: mbaetiong

 Roles: [Audit Orchestrator], [Capability Cartographer]  Energy: 5



## Summary
This document confirms all files required for the “meta propagation”, “component caps”, and “dup heuristic switch” enhancements are included and highlights two additional package markers to stabilize imports across environments.

## Included In Patch (Previously Delivered)
| Area | File | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| Config | .copilot-space/workflow.yaml | Updated: component_caps, dup.heuristic |
| Orchestrator | scripts/space_traversal/audit_runner.py | Updated: meta carry, caps clamp, heuristic switch, manifest |
| Heuristic (opt-in) | scripts/space_traversal/dup_similarity.py | New: token similarity scaffold |
| Template | templates/audit/capability_matrix.md.j2 | Updated: Meta section rendering |
| Docs | docs/validation/Traversal_Workflow.md | Updated: caps formula, heuristic switch, meta note |
| Docs | docs/validation/Usage_Guide.md | Updated: sample YAML + guidance |
| Docs | .github/docs/Space_TraversalWorkflow_Copilot.md | Updated: spec additions |
| Docs | docs/validation/Atomic_Diffs_Next_Unresolved_2025-10-18.md | Updated: status in-progress/deferred |
| Tests | tests/specs/test_audit_meta_in_report.py | New |
| Tests | tests/specs/test_component_caps_clamp.py | New |
| Tests | tests/specs/test_dup_similarity.py | New |

## Additional Files (Now Included)
| File | Purpose | Impact |
|------|---------|--------|
| scripts/__init__.py | Mark top-level scripts as a package | Stabilizes absolute imports in varied runners |
| scripts/space_traversal/__init__.py | Mark space_traversal as a subpackage | Enables clean import of dup_similarity |

Notes:
- The audit runner gracefully falls back to the “simple” heuristic if dup_similarity import fails, but adding package markers ensures “token_similarity” loads reliably when enabled.

## Conclusion
- With the two package markers added, no further files are required for this iteration.
- All scope items are implemented, documented, and covered by smoke tests.
- Future optional work (beyond v1.1.0): evolve token similarity, coverage ingestion, and trend aggregation as per roadmap.
