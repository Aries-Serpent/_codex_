You’re right to call out the apparent contradiction. Let’s nail it down precisely, then give you a **complete, validated implementation guide** you can drop into your internal runbooks so teams can use **GitHub Copilot in the CLI** on Ubuntu 24.x reliably—and understand exactly what it is (and is not).

# Reconciling the discrepancy (one paragraph you can quote)

* **True:** There is **no public programmatic inference API** to call GitHub Copilot (or Copilot Chat) from an external agent like Codex. You can’t fetch Copilot’s suggestions by HTTP API the way you do with OpenAI, nor can you legally scrape its IDE channel. Multiple official references and community threads confirm this. ([Stack Overflow][1])
* **Also true:** GitHub ships an **official Copilot integration for terminals** as a **GitHub CLI extension**: `gh copilot`. It runs locally in a shell, relies on your GitHub account entitlements, and provides *interactive* commands—primarily `explain` and `suggest`—plus shell aliases. That’s not an API; it’s a **user-facing client** on top of your GitHub auth. ([GitHub Docs][2])

The rest of this document is a full, implementation-grade guide for Ubuntu 24.x, written so an infra/enablement team can operate and support it at scale.

# 1) What “Copilot in the CLI” is (and isn’t)

**What it is**

* An official **GitHub CLI extension** (`github/gh-copilot`) that adds a chat-like Copilot experience in your terminal. The two core commands are:

  * `gh copilot explain "<cmd>"` → explains a command.
  * `gh copilot suggest "<task>"` → suggests a shell/git/gh command for your task, with an interactive flow to refine/execute. ([GitHub][3])
* Optional **aliases** (`ghcs`, `ghce`) to speed up usage and allow (opt-in) execution of suggested commands. ([The GitHub Blog][4])

**What it isn’t**

* Not an API you can call “headless” for completions. It is primarily **interactive**. Some users request non-interactive/STDOUT modes, but they are not generally available as of now. ([GitHub][5])

---

# 2) Prerequisites & entitlements (Ubuntu 24.x)

1. **GitHub account with Copilot access** (Free/Pro/Business/Enterprise per your plan; orgs can restrict CLI usage). ([GitHub Docs][6])
2. **GitHub CLI `gh` installed and authenticated** with OAuth (PATs are not supported by the extension; clear `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` if they interfere). On Ubuntu 24 (“Noble”), `gh` is in APT. ([GitHub][7])
3. **Install the extension**: `gh extension install github/gh-copilot`. ([GitHub Docs][8])
4. **Network**: if you’re behind a corporate firewall/proxy, allowlist Copilot endpoints per plan (Business: `*.business.githubcopilot.com`, Enterprise: `*.enterprise.githubcopilot.com`; generally `*.githubcopilot.com`). ([GitHub Docs][9])

---

# 3) Installation & first-run checklist (copy/paste for Ubuntu 24.x)

```bash
# Update packages & install gh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y gh

# Authenticate gh (choose HTTPS + “Login with a web browser”)
gh auth login

# Install Copilot in the CLI extension
gh extension install github/gh-copilot

# Smoke test: show help
gh copilot --help
```

* The **install** and **usage** steps above are exactly what GitHub documents (and what the extension README states). ([GitHub Docs][8])

**Org policy note.** If your organization restricts Copilot (or specifically “Copilot in the CLI”), owners must enable it in Copilot org settings/policies. ([GitHub Docs][6])

---

# 4) Daily usage (what users actually run)

### 4.1 Explain a command

```bash
gh copilot explain "sudo apt-get"
```

Copilot returns a human-readable explanation of the command and flags. ([GitHub Docs][2])

### 4.2 Suggest a command for a task

```bash
gh copilot suggest "Undo the last commit"
```

You’ll get an **interactive** flow where Copilot asks whether this should be a “generic shell”, `git`, or `gh` command, then proposes options (copy/execute/explain further). ([GitHub Docs][2])

### 4.3 Optional: teach the shell the short aliases (Bash/Zsh)

```bash
# Bash
echo 'eval "$(gh copilot alias -- bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc

# Zsh
echo 'eval "$(gh copilot alias -- zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
```

After this, you can use:

* `ghce "what does 'iptables -L' do?"`  (explain)
* `ghcs "find 10 largest files under /var/log, human-readable"` (suggest/execute)
  Official docs describe these aliases and why you should use the generator (not hand-written shell aliases) if you want **execution** to work. ([GitHub Docs][10])

### 4.4 Configure behavior (confirmation & analytics)

```bash
gh copilot config
```

From here, you can set the **default execution confirmation** (so `ghcs` won’t prompt every time) and opt in/out of **usage analytics**. GitHub documents those toggles and the sample telemetry payload. ([GitHub Docs][11])

---

# 5) Admin / enterprise setup: network & policy

**Policy & access**

* Owners enroll the org in Copilot (Business/Enterprise), set policies, and grant member access. This is where an org might also choose to **disable** Copilot in the CLI. ([GitHub Docs][6])

**Firewalls & egress**

* Allowlist Copilot service domains by subscription tier; GitHub has an explicit allowlist reference and documented change history for service endpoints. ([GitHub Docs][9])
* If you enforce subscription-based routing (e.g., block Individual), GitHub’s changelog explains the policy and firewall story. ([The GitHub Blog][12])

**Proxies & custom certificates**

* Copilot supports HTTP proxy/custom certs (most docs discuss IDEs, but the same network endpoints matter for the CLI extension because it rides the same service). ([GitHub Docs][13])

---

# 6) Automation reality (for platform teams & agent builders)

* **No programmatic Copilot inference API.** That’s unchanged. You cannot “wire Codex to call Copilot” via HTTP. ([Stack Overflow][1])
* **The CLI is designed for humans**: interactive prompts (choose target: shell/git/gh; choose copy/execute/etc.). Users have requested **non-interactive/STDOUT** modes, but they’re not general features today. You’ll find open issues requesting just that. ([GitHub][5])
* If you need a **bridge** so Codex and Copilot have *shared context*, do it the supported way: expose your retrieval/tools via HTTP, point **Codex** directly at them, and expose those same tools to **Copilot Chat** via **Copilot Extensions** or **MCP** (so **Copilot → your services**, not **Codex → Copilot**). ([Microsoft Learn][14])

# 7) Troubleshooting (field issues + fixes)

| Symptom                                   | Likely cause                      | What to check / fix                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gh copilot` says feature disabled        | Org policy forbids CLI            | Ask org owner to enable Copilot in CLI / grant access. ([GitHub Docs][6])                                                 |
| `gh copilot` installed but auth fails     | Using PAT env vars / not OAuth    | Clear `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` and login with `gh auth login` OAuth. Extension docs note PATs unsupported. ([GitHub][3]) |
| No suggestions / network errors           | Firewall/proxy blocking endpoints | Allowlist Copilot domains for your plan; confirm outbound TLS works. ([GitHub Docs][9])                                   |
| Aliases `ghcs`/`ghce` don’t work          | Aliases not generated correctly   | Use `gh copilot alias -- bash | zsh | pwsh` per docs; don’t hand-craft if you want execution. ([GitHub Docs][11]) |
| Want headless output to script            | CLI is interactive                | Not supported; see open feature requests. Consider alternative flows/tools. ([GitHub][5])                                 |
| TUI copy-to-clipboard weird in automation | Interactive design                | Users try `expect`; it’s finicky because the TUI isn’t built for scripting. ([Stack Overflow][15])                        |
| “What are the actual commands?”           | Command reference                 | Core verbs are `explain`, `suggest`, plus `config` and `alias`. ([DEV Community][16])                                     |

---

# 8) Security & privacy notes your compliance team will ask about

* **Execution confirmation**: by default, Copilot CLI requires confirmation before executing a suggested command; you can change that default in `gh copilot config`. This is an intentional guardrail. ([GitHub Docs][11])
* **Usage analytics**: you can **opt out/in** in the same config flow; GitHub documents the shape of telemetry (high-level, product-quality signals). ([GitHub Docs][10])
* **Duplication detection / public code matches** & other Copilot controls exist, but they apply to IDE/Chat experiences. For enterprise compliance and data routing you should follow GitHub’s Copilot policy docs (Business/Enterprise) and network allowlists. ([GitHub Docs][9])

# 9) Full command cookbook (Ubuntu 24.x)

### 9.1 Install and authenticate

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y gh
gh auth login  # browser OAuth
gh extension install github/gh-copilot
```

([GitHub Docs][8])

### 9.2 Quick explain & suggest

```bash
gh copilot explain "sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1"
gh copilot suggest "kill process listening on port 3000"
```

([GitHub Docs][2])

### 9.3 Speed with aliases (and allow execution)

```bash
# Bash
echo 'eval "$(gh copilot alias -- bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
ghce "what does 'journalctl -u ssh' do?"
ghcs "archive current dir to tar.gz excluding .git"  # choose Execute in the TUI
```

([GitHub Docs][10])

### 9.4 Configure confirmation & analytics

```bash
gh copilot config    # set default execution confirmation; toggle analytics
```

([GitHub Docs][11])

# 10) Differences vs the older “Copilot CLI” (npm) people still mention

* There was an earlier **npm** tool (`@githubnext/github-copilot-cli`). The official, supported path today is the **`gh` extension** (`github/gh-copilot`). The GitHub blog and docs highlight the extension’s **GA** and built-in alias support. If you previously used `??`, `?`, or `gh?` shortcuts from community scripts, migrate to `gh copilot` + `gh copilot alias`. ([npm][17])

---

# 11) Frequently asked (with precise answers)

**Q:** Can I call Copilot from Codex (or any other agent) to get suggestions programmatically?  
**A:** **No.** There is no public inference API. Use the `gh copilot` **interactive** client, or integrate Copilot **Chat** in supported IDEs, or build a bridge where *both* Copilot and Codex call **your** services (Extensions/MCP for Copilot; HTTP for Codex). ([Stack Overflow][1])

**Q:** Can `gh copilot suggest` run non-interactively and print only the command to STDOUT?  
**A:** Not today; there are open issues requesting this. The designed path is interactive selection and (optionally) execution via alias. ([GitHub][5])

**Q:** What commands exist in the CLI?  
**A:** `explain`, `suggest`, `config`, and `alias`. Examples are in GitHub’s docs and README. ([DEV Community][16])

**Q:** Does this work on Ubuntu 24.x terminals?  
**A:** Yes. Install `gh` from APT (or GitHub’s packages), auth, install the extension, and you’re good. ([GitHub][7])

**Q:** Our enterprise blocks traffic. What exactly must be allowed?  
**A:** Allow `*.githubcopilot.com` generically, and specifically **Business**: `*.business.githubcopilot.com`, **Enterprise**: `*.enterprise.githubcopilot.com`. See GitHub’s allowlist and network routing notes. ([GitHub Docs][18])

## Bottom line

There’s no inconsistency once you separate **“API access”** (not available) from **“official CLI client”** (available, interactive, policy-controlled). If your goal is “Codex and Copilot cooperate,” use the **bridge pattern** so both systems access the **same internal tools**, instead of trying to make one call the other. If your goal is simply “use Copilot in Ubuntu terminals,” the steps above are production-ready and policy-compliant.
