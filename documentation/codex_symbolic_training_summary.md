# ChatGPT Codex — Symbolic Training Summary (Updated)

### Stages (conceptual)

1. **Pretraining**
   Large-scale next-token modeling on code + text → general coding fluency. ([OpenAI][1], [OpenAI][2])

2. **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**
   Curated demonstrations (coding tasks, fixes, explanations) align outputs toward developer intent. ([OpenAI][1])

3. **RLHF (policy optimization)**
   Train a reward model from human preferences; optimize the policy (e.g., PPO). Extensions may include rule-based rewards for safety. ([OpenAI][3], [OpenAI][4])

### Symbolic pipeline

```
Let M₀ = Base Codex (pretrained)
Codex:
 M₀ — SFT(curated code demos) → M₁ — RLHF(reward model, PPO) → M₂ (deployed utility)
```

Where the RLHF reward model is trained from human preference comparisons over model outputs. ([OpenAI][3])

The reference implementation in ``src/codex_ml/symbolic_pipeline.py`` provides
light‑weight yet functional training loops for each stage.  Tokenisation and
dataset handling compute token counts and supervised losses exactly, and the
RLHF phase performs a PPO‑style update against a trained reward model.  A
simple safety regulariser penalises disallowed tokens.  Dedicated tests ensure
reproducibility (deterministic seeds), validate configuration errors and cover
edge cases such as empty corpora or missing preference data.

The accompanying reference implementation in ``codex_ml.symbolic_pipeline`` uses a
deterministic whitespace tokenizer, unigram language model pretraining,
supervised updates based on demonstration token frequencies, and a simple
bag‑of‑words reward model.  The RLHF stage performs a PPO‑style update with a
KL regularizer to the pretrained model and rule‑based penalties for unsafe
tokens.

## Objective (schematic)

$$
\min_{M}\; \mathcal{L}(M)
= \alpha\,\mathcal{L}_{\text{SFT}}(M; D_{\text{code}})\;+\;
  \beta\,\mathcal{L}_{\text{RLHF}}(M; R)\;+\;
  \gamma\,\Omega(M)
$$

* $\mathcal{L}_{\text{SFT}}$: supervised loss on curated coding data
* $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RLHF}}$: preference-based reward optimization (e.g., PPO with a learned RM)
* $\Omega(M)$: regularizers/safety constraints (can include rule-based rewards)
* $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$: phase weights. ([OpenAI][3], [OpenAI][4])

### Data/feedback flow (symbolic)

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\textbf{Pretraining:}& \text{Corpora}_{\text{text,code}} \;\rightarrow\; M_0 \\
&\textbf{SFT:}& (M_0, D_{\text{demos}}) \;\xrightarrow{\text{supervised}}\; M_1 \\
&\textbf{RM training:}& D_{\text{prefs}}=(x, y_A, y_B, \ell)\;\rightarrow\; \text{RewardModel} \\
&\textbf{RLHF:}& (M_1,\text{RewardModel}) \;\xrightarrow{\text{PPO}}\; M_2
\end{aligned}
$$

Demonstrations ($D_{\text{demos}}$) and preference pairs ($D_{\text{prefs}}$) are obtained from human labelers; RM predicts preferred outputs; PPO optimizes the policy against RM (optionally mixed with rule-based rewards for safety). ([OpenAI][3], [OpenAI][4])

### Notes specific to Codex

* Codex is an OpenAI coding agent/product line built on our most capable models; its training lineage follows the Pretraining → SFT → RLHF paradigm used across deployed assistants. ([OpenAI][5])

### Implementation & tests

The repository includes a functional implementation in ``src/codex_ml/symbolic_pipeline.py`` which replaces the earlier stubs with real tokenisation, dataset handling and optimisation loops.  RLHF is realised via a small PPO trainer with KL-based safety regularisation, and all stages honour deterministic seeding.

Unit tests in ``tests/test_symbolic_pipeline.py`` verify reproducibility, validate configuration errors and guard against empty datasets or missing preference data, ensuring robustness of the example pipeline.
