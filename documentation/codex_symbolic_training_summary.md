# ChatGPT Codex — Symbolic Training Summary

This document summarizes the high-level training trajectory for ChatGPT Codex using symbolic notation. It consolidates the core stages—pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)—and sketches the data and objective flow.

## Stages

1. **Pretraining** – Large-scale next-token prediction on mixed code and text corpora to learn general coding fluency. [^1] [^2]
2. **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)** – Aligns the pretrained model with curated demonstrations of coding tasks, fixes, and explanations. [^1]
3. **RLHF (Policy Optimization)** – A reward model, trained on human preference comparisons, guides a policy optimization step (e.g., PPO) to produce the deployed assistant. Rule-based rewards can be mixed in for safety constraints. [^3] [^4]

## Symbolic Pipeline

```
Let M₀ = Base Codex (pretrained)
Codex:
  M₀ — SFT(curated code demos) → M₁ — RLHF(reward model, PPO) → M₂ (deployed utility)
```

Here the reward model is derived from human preference pairs and scores candidate outputs. [^3]

## Objective (schematic)

$$
\min_{M}\; \mathcal{L}(M)
= \alpha\,\mathcal{L}_{\text{SFT}}(M; D_{\text{code}})\;+\;
  \beta\,\mathcal{L}_{\text{RLHF}}(M; R)\;+\;
  \gamma\,\Omega(M)
$$

- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{SFT}}$: supervised loss on curated coding data
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RLHF}}$: preference-based reward optimization (e.g., PPO with a learned RM)
- $\Omega(M)$: regularizers or safety constraints (may include rule-based rewards)
- $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$: phase weights [^3] [^4]

## Data and Feedback Flow

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\textbf{Pretraining:}& \text{Corpora}_{\text{text,code}} \;\rightarrow\; M_0 \\
&\textbf{SFT:}& (M_0, D_{\text{demos}}) \;\xrightarrow{\text{supervised}}\; M_1 \\
&\textbf{RM training:}& D_{\text{prefs}}=(x, y_A, y_B, \ell)\;\rightarrow\; \text{RewardModel} \\
&\textbf{RLHF:}& (M_1,\text{RewardModel}) \;\xrightarrow{\text{PPO}}\; M_2
\end{aligned}
$$

Human labelers supply demonstration data $D_{\text{demos}}$ and preference pairs $D_{\text{prefs}}$. The reward model predicts preferred outputs, and PPO optimizes the policy against that model while optionally incorporating rule-based safety rewards. [^3] [^4]

## Notes on Codex

OpenAI Codex is a product line of coding assistants built on this training lineage, which follows the pretraining → SFT → RLHF paradigm. [^5]
