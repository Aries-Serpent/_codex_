# ChatGPT Codex — Symbolic Training Summary (Updated)

### Stages (conceptual)

1. **Pretraining**
   Large-scale next-token modeling on code + text → general coding fluency. ([OpenAI][1], [OpenAI][2])

2. **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**
   Curated demonstrations (coding tasks, fixes, explanations) align outputs toward developer intent. ([OpenAI][1])

3. **RLHF (policy optimization)**
   Train a reward model from human preferences; optimize the policy (e.g., PPO). Extensions may include rule-based rewards for safety. ([OpenAI][3], [OpenAI][4])

### Symbolic pipeline

```
Let M₀ = Base Codex (pretrained)
Codex:
  M₀ — SFT(curated code demos) → M₁ — RLHF(reward model, PPO) → M₂ (deployed utility)
```

Where the RLHF reward model is trained from human preference comparisons over model outputs. ([OpenAI][3])

### Objective (schematic)

$$
\min_{M}\; \mathcal{L}(M)
= \alpha\,\mathcal{L}_{\text{SFT}}(M; D_{\text{code}})\;+\;
  \beta\,\mathcal{L}_{\text{RLHF}}(M; R)\;+\;
  \gamma\,\Omega(M)
$$

* $\mathcal{L}_{\text{SFT}}$: supervised loss on curated coding data
* $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RLHF}}$: preference-based reward optimization (e.g., PPO with a learned RM)
* $\Omega(M)$: regularizers/safety constraints (can include rule-based rewards)
* $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$: phase weights. ([OpenAI][3], [OpenAI][4])

### Data/feedback flow (symbolic)

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\textbf{Pretraining:}& \text{Corpora}_{\text{text,code}} \;\rightarrow\; M_0 \\
&\textbf{SFT:}& (M_0, D_{\text{demos}}) \;\xrightarrow{\text{supervised}}\; M_1 \\
&\textbf{RM training:}& D_{\text{prefs}}=(x, y_A, y_B, \ell)\;\rightarrow\; \text{RewardModel} \\
&\textbf{RLHF:}& (M_1,\text{RewardModel}) \;\xrightarrow{\text{PPO}}\; M_2
\end{aligned}
$$

Demonstrations ($D_{\text{demos}}$) and preference pairs ($D_{\text{prefs}}$) are obtained from human labelers; RM predicts preferred outputs; PPO optimizes the policy against RM (optionally mixed with rule-based rewards for safety). ([OpenAI][3], [OpenAI][4])

### Notes specific to Codex

* Codex is an OpenAI coding agent/product line built on our most capable models; its training lineage follows the Pretraining → SFT → RLHF paradigm used across deployed assistants. ([OpenAI][5])

### Implementation notes

The accompanying `symbolic_pipeline` module implements these stages with real
training loops and evaluation metrics:

* **Tokenisation & data handling** – all text is tokenised so that token counts
  and supervised cross‑entropy losses are computed accurately.
* **Reward model & PPO** – a logistic reward model is trained on preference
  pairs and a PPO loop with a KL safety penalty optimises the policy against it.
* **Reproducibility & validation** – deterministic seeds are built in and tests
  cover edge cases such as empty datasets or mis‑specified configurations to
  ensure robustness.
