# Ingestion Package

The `ingestion` package will host data ingestion utilities.

Currently, it contains a placeholder :class:`Ingestor` class defined in
`__init__.py`. The class has no behavior yet but will be expanded to
support various data ingestion pipelines.

## Status

This module is scaffolded and not yet functional. Future updates will
implement ingestion logic and accompanying tests.
