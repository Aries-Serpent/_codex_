"""Utility helpers for computing checksums.

This module intentionally keeps a tiny surface area so it can be imported
without pulling in heavy thirdâ€‘party dependencies.  The helper mirrors the
``sha256sum`` CLI behaviour by streaming files in fixed-size chunks which keeps
memory usage predictable for large checkpoints.
