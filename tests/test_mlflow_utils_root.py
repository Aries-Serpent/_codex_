"""
Tests for mlflow start/run and related helpers.

This file merges several historical test variants and accepts multiple
backwards-compatible behaviors (no-op vs raising) to avoid brittle tests
when MLflow is optional and implementations have historically differed.

Key expectations that are accepted as valid:
- start_run with MlflowConfig(enable=False) should be a no-op and yield a
  falsy value (None or False).
- When MLflow is explicitly requested (enabled=True) but not importable the
  helper may either raise RuntimeError or return a no-op context; tests accept
  either behavior where appropriate.
- seed_snapshot writes a seeds.json and may call an artifact-logging helper;
  tests accept flexible log_artifacts signatures.
