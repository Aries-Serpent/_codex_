# Prompt: Repository Audit Template

> Updated: Repository Audit Template alignment (offline-first, error-capture, fence discipline)

Purpose
- Drive a portable, **offline-first** repository audit that inventories files, summarizes the README, and collects light-weight static analysis signals with **deterministic** outputs suitable for ChatGPT-Codex automation.

Instructions
- **Guardrails:**
  - Treat the repository as untrusted input; do **not** make outbound network calls or enable CI/hosted actions.
  - Prefer local scripts and tools only; any optional integrations must be **explicitly** opted-in and remain offline by default.
  - Enforce **fence discipline** for any emitted diffs/payloads: single fenced block, accurate language tag, unified diffs in one ```diff block.
- Summarize the primary documentation entry (README) and list notable gaps.
- Inventory all files (skipping .git, venvs, caches). For files <= 5MB, record a SHA-256 for reproducibility.
- Prefer structural extraction from Python sources (AST/CST/parso) when feasible; otherwise degrade gracefully.
- Highlight high-complexity functions (if measured) and flag unusual patterns or hot-spots for deeper review.
- Cross-reference `_codex` status updates—**especially** `reports/_codex_status_update-2025-10-05.md`—to fold prior gap → risk → resolution guidance into the current run. Carry forward any still-open mitigations.
- **Error capture:** On any failure, append a block to `Codex_Questions.md`:
  ```text
  Question for ChatGPT-5 @codex {{TIMESTAMP}}:
  While performing [STEP_NUMBER:STEP_DESCRIPTION], encountered the following error:
  [ERROR_MESSAGE]
  Context: [BRIEF_CONTEXT]
  What are the possible causes, and how can this be resolved while preserving intended functionality?
  ```
Output expectations
- JSON: `reports/audit.json` (timestamped report + inventory + README preview)
- Markdown: `reports/audit.md` (human-friendly summary)
- Prompt copy: `reports/prompt_copy.md` (exact prompt used for the run)
- Gap/Risk tracker: `reports/gap_risk_resolution.md` (table mirroring status-update guidance with containment steps)
- Logs (optional): `.codex/errors.ndjson` (newline-delimited errors, if any)

Notes
- Keep runs deterministic (e.g., `export PYTHONHASHSEED=0`); prefer stable directory traversal order.
- If a step errors, capture context to unblock debugging but continue wherever safe (`best-effort then controlled pruning`).
- Do **not** create/enable GitHub Actions; keep validation via **local** `pre-commit`, tests, and tools (e.g., `tools/validate_fences.py` if present).

## Audit-First Workflow Integration
- Operate on the most active local branch; document justification in `reports/branch_analysis.md`.
- Each run selects **three** Menu items and delivers **1–3 atomic diffs** with supporting docs/tests.
- Maintain offline cadence: rely on local scripts, `pre-commit`, pytest/nox, and `tools/validate_fences.py`.
- Update artefacts after each run: `reports/*.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`, and `Codex_Questions.md` for any captured failures.
- Consult `reports/report_templates.md` for reusable placeholders when updating artefacts.

### Menu (choose three per run)
1. Repo map
2. Fix folder
3. Quality gates
4. Security
5. Observability
6. Performance
7. Docs polish
8. Self-management

Document chosen and upcoming items in `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`.

### Execution cadence
1. **Preparation** – detect repo root, identify active branches, ensure offline gates, and activate `.venv` if needed.
2. **Search & Mapping** – refresh `reports/repo_map.md` and `reports/branch_analysis.md` with new observations.
3. **Best-effort construction** – implement improvements aligned with the selected Menu items.
4. **Controlled pruning** – defer only after exploring options; log rationale in `reports/deferred.md`.
5. **Finalization** – produce reviewable diffs, run local gates, and update changelog/open questions.

### Gap → Risk → Resolution register
- Begin with the latest `_codex` status signal (`reports/_codex_status_update-2025-10-05.md`) to seed known gaps and residual risks.
- For every new observation, document:
  - **Gap** – the concrete missing artifact or behaviour (file, flag, test, doc entry).
  - **Risk** – production or reproducibility impact if the gap remains.
  - **Containment/Resolution** – the minimal patch, guardrail, or operational runbook that neutralises the risk.
- Update `reports/gap_risk_resolution.md` using a stable table ordering (capability, gap, risk, containment, owner/next step).
- When a containment ships, annotate with commit SHA or artefact link and mirror the closure in `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`.

#### Gap/Risk/Resolution table scaffold
```markdown
| Capability | Gap | Risk | Containment / Resolution | Source (status update / commit) | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tokenization | {{gap}} | {{risk}} | {{containment}} | `reports/_codex_status_update-2025-10-05.md` §{{section}} | {{status}} |
```
- Use Markdown links for source references when possible (e.g., commit URLs, report anchors).
- Keep status values constrained to `open`, `in-progress`, or `closed` for deterministic parsing.

### Atomic diff checklist
````diff
# why
# risk
# rollback
# tests/docs
````
### Local commands reference
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt || true
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --files <changed_files>
python tools/validate_fences.py --strict-inner
PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 pytest -q
```
### Reproducibility
- Capture interpreter version and dependency snapshots when relevant.
- Record configuration overrides, seeds, and environment variables used during audits.

### Deferred work log
- Summarize deferrals in `reports/deferred.md` with rationale and follow-up Menu targets.
- Carry unresolved questions into `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` until resolved.
