Repository

- Name: Aries-Serpent/_codex_
- Languages: Python (94.4%), Shell (5.5%), Other (0.1%)
- Description: codex managed repo

Instructions
You are an internal static analysis assistant in a Codex environment only—offline, no remote CI or network communications allowed (no GitHub Actions, no W&B remote runs, etc.).

Check for must recent active branch:
//fetch https://github.com/Aries-Serpent/_codex_/activity?time_period=day

Conpare & Focus on Active Branches:
//fetch https://github.com/Aries-Serpent/_codex_
//fetch https://github.com/Aries-Serpent/_codex_/tree/0A_base_
//fetch https://github.com/Aries-Serpent/_codex_/tree/0B_base_
//fetch https://github.com/Aries-Serpent/_codex_/tree/0C_base_

Objective:
> Traverse the repository and provide a comprehensive status audit. The goal is to assess **modularity**, **reproducibility**, and **production readiness** of the Codex Environment for Ubuntu, following best practices in ML systems design.
---

Analyze the entire repository and produce a thorough implementation-status audit covering the following system areas. **Note that the only prohibited action is enabling or producing any `yaml` files that will initiate a Cost Incurring GitHub Action. ALL pre-commit checks must run solely within Codex environment only— (no GitHub Actions, no GitHub Workflow Runs, etc.).** Traverse all code, scripts, configs, tests, docs, and notebooks. Use the following structure:

Audit Scope

1. **Repo Map**
   - List top-level directories and key files.
   - Identify stubs (`TODO`, `NotImplementedError`, `pass`, placeholders) and unimplemented areas.

2. **Capability Audit Table**

   For each **capability** below, provide:

   - **Status**: `Implemented` / `Partially Implemented` / `Stubbed` / `Missing`
   - **Existing artifacts**: modules, classes, functions, configs
   - **Gaps**: what's missing exactly (files, flags, tests, CLI hooks)
   - **Risks**: what could break in production
   - **Minimal Patch Plan**: small, reviewable diffs and tests to implement
   - **Rollback Plan**: how to revert safely if needed

   **Capabilities list:**
   - Tokenization (fast tokenizer, vocab, encode/decode, padding/truncation)
   - ChatGPT Codex Modeling (model init, dtype, device placement, LoRA/PEFT hooks)
   - Training Engine (HF Trainer or custom loop, precision, gradient accumulation)
   - Configuration Management (Hydra/YAML structure, overrides, sweeps)
   - Evaluation & Metrics (validation loops, metrics API, NDJSON/CSV logging)
   - Logging & Monitoring (TensorBoard / W&B / MLflow, system metrics via `psutil`/NVML)
   - Checkpointing & Resume (weights, optimizer state, scheduler, RNG, best-k retention)
   - Data Handling (dataset splits, deterministic shuffling, caching)
   - Security & Safety (dependency locking, secrets scanning, prompt safety)
   - Internal CI/Test (pytest targets, tox/nox local gates, coverage enforcement)
   - Deployment (packaging, CLI entry points, Docker infra)
   - Documentation & Examples (README, quickstarts, diagrams, notebooks)
   - Experiment Tracking (MLflow local tracking, W&B offline mode)
   - Extensibility (pluggable components, registry patterns)

3. **High-Signal Findings**
   - 10–20 bullet summary of the most critical readiness gaps and quick wins.

4. **Atomic Diffs**
   - Provide 3–10 example unified diffs implementing key fixes: minimal, high-impact scaffolds (e.g. guarded MLflow init, Hydra defaults, LoRA wiring). Each diff must include:
     - *Why*: rationale
     - *Risk*: what could break
     - *Rollback*: revert instructions
     - *Tests/docs*: what must also be added

5. **Local Tests & Gates**
   - Create or update `pytest`, `nox`, or `tox` sessions strictly for offline gating. Provide commands and example outputs.
   - Map new tests to **ML Test Score** categories: data, model, infrastructure, regression, performance.

6. **Reproducibility Checklist**
   - Fill in a short checklist: seeds, environment capture, code versioning, results determinism.
   - Flag missing items per reproducibility best practices. (Reference MLOps reproducibility checklist.)

7. **Deferred Items**
   - For any unimplemented features, include *pruning rationale*: complexity, lack of ownership, risk.
   - Suggest minimal future plans.

8. **Error Capture Blocks**
   - Whenever any analysis step fails, record a block:

```
Question for ChatGPT @codex {{timestamp}}:
While performing [STEP_NUMBER:STEP_DESCRIPTION], encountered the following error:
[ERROR_MESSAGE]
Context: [BRIEF_CONTEXT]
What are the possible causes, and how can this be resolved while preserving intended functionality?
```

---

### Usage

Run:
```bash
chatgpt-codex --prompt-file AUDIT_PROMPT.md --output-format markdown > _codex_status_update-(YYYY-MM-DD).md

```

Then, **Use the following template below** to frame a ChatGPT Codex Tailored Prompts explicitly complete to achieve fully functional code, docs, contexts for completion of all mentioned gaps, missing, and incomplete aspects mentioned from High-Signal Findings, Atomic Diffs, Local Tests & Gates, all items on Reproducibility Checklist.
---

```
**Codex-ready Task Sequence** 
Transform the supplied task below into a **Codex-ready sequential execution block** that: 
1. Enforces **best-effort construction** before pruning. 
2. Explicitly explores related modules, scripts, or tooling in depth. 
3. Compares purposes and identifies whether a viable mapping or adaptation can be made. 
4. Only after exhausting all possibilities should an item be pruned, and **pruning must include documented rationale**. 
5. Includes explicit **error capture** formatted as a research question tailored for ChatGPT @codex to investigate and provide solutions. 
6. Scripts will typically be in python, bash, sql, javascript, html, etc 

**Structure Requirements:** 
- **Sequential, numbered execution phases** (Preparation, Search & Mapping, Best-Effort Construction, Controlled Pruning, Error Capture, Finalization). 
- Must be **ready for Codex to execute until completion**. 
- Detailed sub-steps under each phase. 
- Error capture block must format questions like: 
> Question from ChatGPT @codex {{timestamp}}:  
> While performing \[STEP\_NUMBER\:STEP\_DESCRIPTION], encountered the following error: \[ERROR\_MESSAGE] Context: \[BRIEF\_CONTEXT]. What are the possible causes, and how can this be resolved while preserving intended functionality? 

**Additional Deliverable:** 
After producing the sequential execution block, also generate an **executable script** (Python and CLI, Bash as needed) sequential Codex-ready execution blocks that implements the workflow end-to-end, including: 
- README parsing and reference replacement/removal 
- File search and adaptation attempt - Gap documentation in a change log - Error capture and formatting for ChatGPT @codex research questions 
- Finalization with updated deliverables 
- **Note that the only prohibited action is enabling or producing any `yaml` files that will initiate a Cost Incurring GitHub Action. ALL pre-commit checks must run solely within Codex environment only— (no GitHub Actions, etc.).**
