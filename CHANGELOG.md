## Migration Guides

### Upgrading from 1.x to 2.0

#### Universal Task Interface

**Old (1.x - direct dict):**
```python
result = uti.execute_task({
    "environment": "gridworld",
    "initial_state": {"x": 0, "y": 0},
    # ...
})
```

**New (2.0 - TaskSpec):**
```python
from core.universal_intelligence import TaskSpec

spec = TaskSpec(
    environment="gridworld",
    initial_state={"x": 0, "y": 0},
    reward_spec={"id": "reward:v1"},
    termination={"max_steps": 100},
)
result = uti.execute_task(spec)
```

#### Meta-Policy Router

**Old (1.x):**
```python
router = MetaPolicyRouter(seed=12345)
# Fixed strategy list
```

**New (2.0):**
```python
router = MetaPolicyRouter(seed=12345, strategies=["maml", "reptile"])
# Now supports custom strategy lists and MAML/Reptile
```
